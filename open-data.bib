The report maps out the changes that are required by scientists, their institutions and those that fund and support science if this potential is to be realised.},

These findings are evidence that open research practices bring significant benefits to researchers relative to more traditional closed practices.},

The essence of the approach is that data can be embedded in a human-readable and machine-addressable way within the traditional publishing environment. We show this by example for both computational and experimental data. We articulate a need for new authoring tools to facilitate data sharing, and we discuss the tools we have been developing for this purpose. With these tools, data generation, analysis, and manuscript preparation can be deeply integrated, resulting in easier and better data sharing in scientific publications.},

@article{Budin-Ljøsne2013,
abstract = {Data sharing is essential for the conduct of cutting-edge research and is increasingly required by funders concerned with maximising the scientific yield from research data collections. International research consortia are encouraged to share data intra-consortia, inter-consortia and with the wider scientific community. Little is reported regarding the factors that hinder or facilitate data sharing in these different situations. This paper provides results from a survey conducted in the European Network for Genetic and Genomic Epidemiology (ENGAGE) that collected information from its participating institutions about their data-sharing experiences. The questionnaire queried about potential hurdles to data sharing, concerns about data sharing, lessons learned and recommendations for future collaborations. Overall, the survey results reveal that data sharing functioned well in ENGAGE and highlight areas that posed the most frequent hurdles for data sharing. Further challenges arise for international data sharing beyond the consortium. These challenges are described and steps to help address these are outlined. INTRODUCTION The data-sharing landscape has changed considerably in the last decade due to several factors. First, data sharing is essential to study complex disease aetiology. This has catalysed the formation of international research consortia, each of which must tackle data-sharing issues. The more recent practice of inter-consortia collabora-tions adds yet another layer of complexity to data-sharing solutions and protocols. Second, data sharing is increasingly encouraged by the scientific community and by research funders 1–5 in order to maximise the scientific returns from the data. Third, data sharing raises ethical and legal issues related to the privacy of research participants, which were often not foreseen when cohorts were established. Today, a typical consortium project in genomic sciences must develop solutions for data sharing that span intra-consortium, inter-consortium and sharing with scientific community at large. How easy is it for researchers and projects to fulfil the data-sharing requirements of today's science? Although the literature has emerged concerning the ethical and legal considerations surrounding data sharing, 6–10 there is relatively little guidance for scientists on steps that could be undertaken to facilitate data sharing in consortia projects that need to negotiate this landscape. 11,12 This paper reports on the data-sharing experiences of the European Network for Genetic and Genomic Epidemiology (ENGAGE). 13 The information is based on survey responses from ENGAGE partners who answered questions about situations encountered and provided recommendations to improve data sharing. We describe these results in the context of the data-sharing principles developed within ENGAGE and articulate other data-sharing challenges and solutions of the consortium, including data sharing post ENGAGE. ENGAGE was established in 2008 with the main objective to share and analyse the wealth of data from a number of already-established cohort data sets. 13 At project start, the consortium, funded by the 7 th Framework Programme-Health Theme of the European Commission, comprised data from more than 80 000 genome-wide association scans and DNA and serum/plasma samples from over 600 000 individuals. During its 5-year duration (2008–2012), the 24 research organisations participating in ENGAGE have shared and analysed primarily Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) data to identify hundreds of genetic loci influencing dozens of medically-significant traits, ranging from type 2 diabetes and obesity, to smoking behaviour and birth weight. These discoveries resulted in approximately 170 publications as per August 2012, many of these in high-impact international journals, and more papers are under preparation. 13},

abstract = {The underlying ethos of dbGaP is that access to these data by secondary data analysts facilitates advancement of science. NIH has required that genome-wide association study data be deposited in the Database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP) since 2003. In 2013, a proposed updated policy extended this requirement to next-generation sequencing data. However, recent literature and anecdotal reports suggest lingering logistical and ethical concerns about subject identifiability, informed consent, publication embargo enforcement, and difficulty in accessing dbGaP data. We surveyed the International  Genetic Epidemiology Society (IGES) membership about their experiences. One hundred and seventy five (175) individuals completed the survey, a response rate of 27{\%}.  Of respondents who received data from dbGaP (43{\%}), only 32{\%} perceived the application process as easy but most (75{\%}) received data within five months. Remaining challenges include difficulty in identifying an institutional signing official and an overlong application process. Only 24{\%} of respondents had contributed data to dbGaP. Of these, 31{\%} reported local IRB restrictions on data release; an additional 15{\%} had to reconsent study participants before depositing data. The majority of respondents (56{\%}) disagreed that the publication embargo period was sufficient. In response, we recommend longer embargo periods and use of varied data-sharing models rather than a one-size-fits-all approach.},

Research combining a variety of georeferenced data is spreading rapidly across scientific domains and international borders. This suggests a growing potential for the use and integration of new and existing data sets to create new multi-disciplinary scientific collaborations. Yet, the unique characteristics of georeferenced data present special challenges to such collaborations. These data are highly identifiable when presented in maps and other visualizations or when combined with sensor data or other related geospatial data sets. The potential opportunities of collaboration may thus be constrained by the need to protect the locational privacy (geoprivacy) and confidentiality of subjects in research using georeferenced data.

Although sharing data is considered a best practice, the barriers to doing so are considerable and there is a need for guidance and examples. To that end, the authors of this article reviewed the articles in this special issue to identify challenges common to the five countries and to offer some practical advice to assist researchers in navigating this "uncharted territory," as some termed it. Concerns around informed consent, data management, data dissemination, and validation of research contributions were cited frequently as particularly challenging areas, so the authors focused on these four topics with the goal of providing specific resources to consult as well as examples of successful projects attempting to solve many of the problems raised.},
