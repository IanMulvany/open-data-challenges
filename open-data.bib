abstract = {Visualizing data is central to social scientific work. Despite a promising early beginning, sociology has lagged in the use of visual tools. We review the history and current state of visualization in sociology. Using examples throughout, we discuss recent developments in ways of seeing raw data and presenting the results of statistical modeling. We make a general distinction between those methods and tools designed to help explore data sets and those designed to help present results to others. We argue that recent advances should be seen as part of a broader shift toward easier sharing of code and data both between researchers and with wider publics, and we encourage practitioners and publishers to work toward a higher and more consistent standard for the graphical display of sociological insights.},

abstract = {The " performativity thesis " is the claim that parts of contemporary economics and finance, when carried out into the world by professionals and popularizers, reformat and reorganize the phenomena they purport to describe, in ways that bring the world into line with theory. Practical technologies, calculative devices and portable algorithms give actors tools to implement particular models of action. I argue that social network analysis is performative in the same sense as the cases studied in this literature. Social network analysis and finance theory are similar in key aspects of their development and effects. For the case of economics, evidence for weaker versions of the performativity thesis is quite good, and the strong formulation is circumstantially supported. Network theory easily meets the evidential threshold for the weaker versions. I offer empirical examples that support the strong (or " Barnesian ") formulation. Whether these parallels are a mark in favor of the thesis or a strike against it is an open question. I argue that the social network technologies and models now being " performed " build out systems of generalized reciprocity, connectivity, and commons-based production. This is in contrast both to an earlier network imagery that emphasized self-interest and entrepreneurial exploitation of structural opportunities, and to the model of action typically considered to be performed by economic technologies.},

Traditionalmodels of social contagionhave been based on physicalanalogieswithbiological contagion, inwhichthe probability that an individual is affected by the contagion grows monotonically with the size of his or her “contact neighborhood”—the number of affected individualswith whomhe or she is in contact.Whereas this contact neighborhood hypothesis has formed the underpinning of essentially all current models, it has been challenging to evaluate it due to the difficulty in obtainingdetaileddataonindividual network neighborhoods during the course of a large-scale contagion process. Herewe study this question by analyzing the growth of Facebook, a rare example of a social process with genuinely global adoption.We find that the probability of contagion is tightly controlled by the number of connected components in an individual's contact neigh- borhood, rather than by the actual size of the neighborhood. Sur- prisingly, once this “structural diversity” is controlled for, the size of the contact neighborhood is in fact generally a negative predictor of contagion. More broadly, our analysis shows how data at the size and resolution of the Facebook network make possible the identifi- cationofsubtle structural signals thatgoundetectedatsmaller scales yet hold pivotal predictive roles for the outcomes of social processes.},

abstract = {Data sharing is essential for the conduct of cutting-edge research and is increasingly required by funders concerned with maximising the scientific yield from research data collections. International research consortia are encouraged to share data intra-consortia, inter-consortia and with the wider scientific community. Little is reported regarding the factors that hinder or facilitate data sharing in these different situations. This paper provides results from a survey conducted in the European Network for Genetic and Genomic Epidemiology (ENGAGE) that collected information from its participating institutions about their data-sharing experiences. The questionnaire queried about potential hurdles to data sharing, concerns about data sharing, lessons learned and recommendations for future collaborations. Overall, the survey results reveal that data sharing functioned well in ENGAGE and highlight areas that posed the most frequent hurdles for data sharing. Further challenges arise for international data sharing beyond the consortium. These challenges are described and steps to help address these are outlined. INTRODUCTION The data-sharing landscape has changed considerably in the last decade due to several factors. First, data sharing is essential to study complex disease aetiology. This has catalysed the formation of international research consortia, each of which must tackle data-sharing issues. The more recent practice of inter-consortia collabora-tions adds yet another layer of complexity to data-sharing solutions and protocols. Second, data sharing is increasingly encouraged by the scientific community and by research funders 1–5 in order to maximise the scientific returns from the data. Third, data sharing raises ethical and legal issues related to the privacy of research participants, which were often not foreseen when cohorts were established. Today, a typical consortium project in genomic sciences must develop solutions for data sharing that span intra-consortium, inter-consortium and sharing with scientific community at large. How easy is it for researchers and projects to fulfil the data-sharing requirements of today's science? Although the literature has emerged concerning the ethical and legal considerations surrounding data sharing, 6–10 there is relatively little guidance for scientists on steps that could be undertaken to facilitate data sharing in consortia projects that need to negotiate this landscape. 11,12 This paper reports on the data-sharing experiences of the European Network for Genetic and Genomic Epidemiology (ENGAGE). 13 The information is based on survey responses from ENGAGE partners who answered questions about situations encountered and provided recommendations to improve data sharing. We describe these results in the context of the data-sharing principles developed within ENGAGE and articulate other data-sharing challenges and solutions of the consortium, including data sharing post ENGAGE. ENGAGE was established in 2008 with the main objective to share and analyse the wealth of data from a number of already-established cohort data sets. 13 At project start, the consortium, funded by the 7 th Framework Programme-Health Theme of the European Commission, comprised data from more than 80 000 genome-wide association scans and DNA and serum/plasma samples from over 600 000 individuals. During its 5-year duration (2008–2012), the 24 research organisations participating in ENGAGE have shared and analysed primarily Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) data to identify hundreds of genetic loci influencing dozens of medically-significant traits, ranging from type 2 diabetes and obesity, to smoking behaviour and birth weight. These discoveries resulted in approximately 170 publications as per August 2012, many of these in high-impact international journals, and more papers are under preparation. 13},

abstract = {The underlying ethos of dbGaP is that access to these data by secondary data analysts facilitates advancement of science. NIH has required that genome-wide association study data be deposited in the Database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP) since 2003. In 2013, a proposed updated policy extended this requirement to next-generation sequencing data. However, recent literature and anecdotal reports suggest lingering logistical and ethical concerns about subject identifiability, informed consent, publication embargo enforcement, and difficulty in accessing dbGaP data. We surveyed the International  Genetic Epidemiology Society (IGES) membership about their experiences. One hundred and seventy five (175) individuals completed the survey, a response rate of 27{\%}.  Of respondents who received data from dbGaP (43{\%}), only 32{\%} perceived the application process as easy but most (75{\%}) received data within five months. Remaining challenges include difficulty in identifying an institutional signing official and an overlong application process. Only 24{\%} of respondents had contributed data to dbGaP. Of these, 31{\%} reported local IRB restrictions on data release; an additional 15{\%} had to reconsent study participants before depositing data. The majority of respondents (56{\%}) disagreed that the publication embargo period was sufficient. In response, we recommend longer embargo periods and use of varied data-sharing models rather than a one-size-fits-all approach.},

abstract = {The ability to replicate, or reproduce, research is fundamental to the scientific process. Research combining a variety of georeferenced data is spreading rapidly across scientific domains and international borders. This suggests a growing potential for the use and integration of new and existing data sets to create new multi-disciplinary scientific collaborations. Yet, the unique characteristics of georeferenced data present special challenges to such collaborations. These data are highly identifiable when presented in maps and other visualizations or when combined with sensor data or other related geospatial data sets. The potential opportunities of collaboration may thus be constrained by the need to protect the locational privacy (geoprivacy) and confidentiality of subjects in research using georeferenced data. This paper reviews the obstacles to and potential methods for sharing georeferenced data in order to support a growing and dynamic geospatial research community and build capacity for data-inte...},

To that end, the authors of this article reviewed the articles in this special issue to identify challenges common to the five countries and to offer some practical advice to assist researchers in navigating this "uncharted territory," as some termed it. Concerns around informed consent, data management, data dissemination, and validation of research contributions were cited frequently as particularly challenging areas, so the authors focused on these four topics with the goal of providing specific resources to consult as well as examples of successful projects attempting to solve many of the problems raised.},

abstract = {In this paper we outline a heuristic algorithm for disambiguating author names of publications via deterministic clustering based on well?defined similarity measures between publications in which their names appear as authors. The algorithm is designed to be used in the construction of a collaboration network, i.e., a graph of author nodes and co?author links. In this context, the goal is to produce a co?authorship graph with network characteristics that are close to those of the “true” collaboration network, so that meaningful network metrics can be determined. The algorithm we present here is fairly easily comprehended as it does not depend on any sophisticated AI techniques. This is important in the context of policy studies, in which we successfully applied it, as it enables policy makers to judge the soundness of the methodology with considerable confidence. It is also quite fast, making it possible to run large?scale analyses (here, in the order of a hundred thousand publications and in the order of a million names to be disambiguated) on a moderately sized desktop computer within a few days. The algorithm is, finally, open to improvement via extensions that take into account additional kinds of fields in bibliographic records of publications to provide evidence that two occurrences of similar names belong to the same individual.},

abstract = {We present a novel algorithm and validation method for disambiguating author names in very large bibliographic data sets and apply it to the full Web of Science (WoS) citation index. Our algorithm relies only upon the author and citation graphs available for the whole period covered by the WoS. A pair-wise publication similarity metric, which is based on common co-authors, self-citations, shared references and citations, is established to perform a two-step agglomerative clustering that first connects individual papers and then merges similar clusters. This parameterized model is optimized using an h-index based recall measure, favoring the correct assignment of well-cited publications, and a name-initials-based precision using WoS metadata and cross-referenced Google Scholar profiles. Despite the use of limited metadata, we reach a recall of 87{\%} and a precision of 88{\%} with a preference for researchers with high h-index values. 47 million articles of WoS can be disambiguated on a single machine in less than a day. We develop an h-index distribution model, confirming that the prediction is in excellent agreement with the empirical data, and yielding insight into the utility of the h-index in real academic ranking scenarios.},

@article{Rangarajan2011,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Journal articles and databases are two major modes of communication in the biological sciences, and thus integrating these critical resources is of urgent importance to increase the pace of discovery. Projects focused on bridging the gap between journals and databases have been on the rise over the last five years and have resulted in the development of automated tools that can recognize entities within a document and link those entities to a relevant database. Unfortunately, automated tools cannot resolve ambiguities that arise from one term being used to signify entities that are quite distinct from one another. Instead, resolving these ambiguities requires some manual oversight. Finding the right balance between the speed and portability of automation and the accuracy and flexibility of manual effort is a crucial goal to making text markup a successful venture.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We have established a journal article mark-up pipeline that links GENETICS journal articles and the model organism database (MOD) WormBase. This pipeline uses a lexicon built with entities from the database as a first step. The entity markup pipeline results in links from over nine classes of objects including genes, proteins, alleles, phenotypes and anatomical terms. New entities and ambiguities are discovered and resolved by a database curator through a manual quality control (QC) step, along with help from authors via a web form that is provided to them by the journal. New entities discovered through this pipeline are immediately sent to an appropriate curator at the database. Ambiguous entities that do not automatically resolve to one link are resolved by hand ensuring an accurate link. This pipeline has been extended to other databases, namely Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD) and FlyBase, and has been implemented in marking up a paper with links to multiple databases.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Our semi-automated pipeline hyperlinks articles published in GENETICS to model organism databases such as WormBase. Our pipeline results in interactive articles that are data rich with high accuracy. The use of a manual quality control step sets this pipeline apart from other hyperlinking tools and results in benefits to authors, journals, readers and databases.},

abstract = {Consider real-time exploration of large multidimensional spatiotemporal datasets with billions of entries, each defined by a location, a time, and other attributes. Are certain attributes correlated spatially or temporally? Are there trends or outliers in the data? Answering these questions requires aggregation over arbitrary regions of the domain and attributes of the data. Many relational databases implement the well-known data cube aggregation operation, which in a sense precomputes every possible aggregate query over the database. Data cubes are sometimes assumed to take a prohibitively large amount of space, and to consequently require disk storage. In contrast, we show how to construct a data cube that fits in a modern laptop's main memory, even for billions of entries; we call this data structure a nanocube. We present algorithms to compute and query a nanocube, and show how it can be used to generate well-known visual encodings such as heatmaps, histograms, and parallel coordinate plots. When compared to exact visualizations created by scanning an entire dataset, nanocube plots have bounded screen error across a variety of scales, thanks to a hierarchical structure in space and time. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique on a variety of real-world datasets, and present memory, timing, and network bandwidth measurements. We find that the timings for the queries in our examples are dominated by network and user-interaction latencies.},

abstract = {Graph analytics is becoming increasingly popular, driving many important business applications from social network analysis to machine learning. Since most graph data is collected in a relational database, it seems natural to attempt to perform graph analytics within the relational environment. However, SQL, the query language for relational databases, makes it difficult to express graph analytics operations. This is because SQL requires programmers to think in terms of tables and joins, rather than the more natural representation of graphs as collections of nodes and edges. As a result, even relatively simple graph operations can require very complex SQL queries. In this paper, we present GRAPHiQL, an intuitive query language for graph analytics, which allows developers to reason in terms of nodes and edges. GRAPHiQL provides key graph constructs such as looping, recursion, and neighborhood operations. At runtime, GRAPHiQL compiles graph programs into efficient SQL queries that can run on any relational database. We demonstrate the applicability of GRAPHiQL on several applications and compare the performance of GRAPHiQL queries with those of Apache Giraph (a popular `vertex centric' graph programming language).},

abstract = {From an herbivore's first bite, plants release herbivory-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) which can attract enemies of herbivores. However, other animals and competing plants can intercept HIPVs for their own use, and it remains unclear whether HIPVs serve as an indirect defense by increasing fitness for the emitting plant. In a 2-year field study, HIPV-emitting N. attenuata plants produced twice as many buds and flowers as HIPV-silenced plants, but only when native Geocoris spp. predators reduced herbivore loads (by 50{\%}) on HIPV-emitters. In concert with HIPVs, plants also employ antidigestive trypsin protease inhibitors (TPIs), but TPI-producing plants were not fitter than TPI-silenced plants. TPIs weakened a specialist herbivore's behavioral evasive responses to simulated Geocoris spp. attack, indicating that TPIs function against specialists by enhancing indirect defense.DOI:http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00007.001.},

@article{Bollen2009,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Intricate maps of science have been created from citation data to visualize the structure of scientific activity. However, most scientific publications are now accessed online. Scholarly web portals record detailed log data at a scale that exceeds the number of all existing citations combined. Such log data is recorded immediately upon publication and keeps track of the sequences of user requests (clickstreams) that are issued by a variety of users across many different domains. Given these advantages of log datasets over citation data, we investigate whether they can produce high-resolution, more current maps of science. METHODOLOGY: Over the course of 2007 and 2008, we collected nearly 1 billion user interactions recorded by the scholarly web portals of some of the most significant publishers, aggregators and institutional consortia. The resulting reference data set covers a significant part of world-wide use of scholarly web portals in 2006, and provides a balanced coverage of the humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences. A journal clickstream model, i.e. a first-order Markov chain, was extracted from the sequences of user interactions in the logs. The clickstream model was validated by comparing it to the Getty Research Institute's Architecture and Art Thesaurus. The resulting model was visualized as a journal network that outlines the relationships between various scientific domains and clarifies the connection of the social sciences and humanities to the natural sciences. CONCLUSIONS: Maps of science resulting from large-scale clickstream data provide a detailed, contemporary view of scientific activity and correct the underrepresentation of the social sciences and humanities that is commonly found in citation data.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Journal impact factors and their ranks are used widely by journals, researchers, and research assessment exercises. METHODS: Based on citations to journals in research and experimental medicine in 2005, Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo methods were used to estimate the uncertainty associated with these journal performance indicators. RESULTS: Intervals representing plausible ranges of values for journal impact factor ranks indicated that most journals cannot be ranked with great precision. Only the top and bottom few journals could place any confidence in their rank position. Intervals were wider and overlapping for most journals. CONCLUSION: Decisions placed on journal impact factors are potentially misleading where the uncertainty associated with the measure is ignored. This article proposes that caution should be exercised in the interpretation of journal impact factors and their ranks, and specifically that a measure of uncertainty should be routinely presented alongside the point estimate.},

Although the impact factor was originally meant for comparison of journals, it is also used for assessment of the quality of individual papers, scientists and departments. For the latter a scientific basis is lacking, as we will demonstrate in this contribution.},

abstract = {I had considered as an alternative title for my talk Citation Sanity and Insanity - the Obsession and Paranoia of Citations and Impact Factors. Others might have preferred Uses and Abuses of Impact Factors. Origins of the Impact Factor I first mentioned the idea of an impact factor in Science magazine in 1955.1 That paper is considered the primordial reference for the concept of the Science Citation Index. Five years later, we began the experimental Genetics Citation Index project which led to the publication of the 1961 Science Citation Index. In 1955, it did not occur to me that impact would one day become so controversial. Like nuclear energy, the impact factor is a mixed blessing. I expected it to be used constructively while recognizing that in the wrong hands it might be abused. Since Current Contents, no less SCI, did not exist, it would have been precocious indeed to contemplate the influence of the nascent impact factor. In the early 1960s, Irving H. Sher and I created the journal impact factor to help select journals for the new Science Citation Index (SCI). To do this we simply re-sorted the author citation index into the journal citation index. From this simple exercise, we learned that initially a core group of large and highly cited journals needed to be covered in the new SCI.},

abstract = {Historically, papers have been physically bound to the journal in which they were published but in the electronic age papers are available individually, no longer tied to their respective journals. Hence, papers now can be read and cited based on their own merits, independently of the journal's physical availability, reputation, or Impact Factor. We compare the strength of the relationship between journals' Impact Factors and the actual citations received by their respective papers from 1902 to 2009. Throughout most of the 20th century, papers' citation rates were increasingly linked to their respective journals' Impact Factors. However, since 1990, the advent of the digital age, the strength of the relation between Impact Factors and paper citations has been decreasing. This decrease began sooner in physics, a field that was quicker to make the transition into the electronic domain. Furthermore, since 1990, the proportion of highly cited papers coming from highly cited journals has been decreasing, and accordingly, the proportion of highly cited papers not coming from highly cited journals has also been increasing. Should this pattern continue, it might bring an end to the use of the Impact Factor as a way to evaluate the quality of journals, papers and researchers.},

@misc{Campbell2008,
abstract = {As Editor-in-Chief of the journal Nature, I am concerned by the tendency within acade- mic administrations to focus on a journal's impact factor when judging the worth of scientific contri- butions by researchers, affecting promotions, recruitment and, in some countries, financial bonuses for each paper. Our own internal research demonstrates how a high journal impact factor can be the skewed result of many citations of a few papers rather than the average level of the majority, reduc- ing its value as an objective measure of an individual paper. Proposed alternative indices have their own drawbacks. Many researchers say that their important work has been published in low-impact journals. Focusing on the citations of individual papers is a more reliable indicator of an individual's impact. A positive development is the increasing ability to track the contributions of individuals by means of author-contribution statements and perhaps, in the future, citability of components of papers rather than the whole. There are attempts to escape the hierarchy of high-impact-factor jour- nals by means of undifferentiated databases of peer-reviewed papers such as PLoS One. It remains to be seen whether that model will help outstanding work to rise to due recognition regardless of editorial selectivity. Although the current system may be effective at measuring merit on national and institutional scales, the most effective and fair analysis of a person's contribution derives from a direct assessment of individual papers, regardless of where they were published.},

By simulation of the change processes of the R-impact factor and impact factor in the manipulation process of the impact factor, it is found that the effect of manipulation can be partly corrected by the R-impact factor in some cases. Based on the Journal Citation Report database, impact factors of 4 normal journals and 4 manipulated journals were collected. The journals' R-impact factors and self-cited rates in the previous two years were calculated for each year during the period 2000 to 2007, and various characteristics influenced by the manipulation were analyzed. We find that the R-impact factor has greater fairness than the impact factor for journals with relatively short cited half-lives. Finally, some issues about using the R-impact factor as a measure for evaluating scientific journals are discussed.},

However, empiric studies on impact factor's validity as an indicator of quality are lacking. The authors assessed the validity of impact factor as a measure of quality for general medical journals by testing its association with journal quality as rated by clinical practitioners and researchers. METHODS: We surveyed physicians specializing in internal medicine in the United States, randomly sampled from the American Medical Association's Physician Masterfile (practitioner group, n = 113) and from a list of graduates from a national postdoctoral training program in clinical and health services research (research group, n = 151). Respondents rated the quality of nine general medical journals, and we assessed the correlation between these ratings and the journals' impact factors. RESULTS: The correlation between impact factor and physicians' ratings of journal quality was strong (r2 = 0.82, P = 0.001). The correlation was higher for the research group (r2 = 0.83, P = 0.001) than for the practitioner group (r2 = 0.62, P = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Impact factor may be a reasonable indicator of quality for general medical journals.},

abstract = {Most researchers acknowledge an intrinsic hierarchy in the scholarly journals ("journal rank") that they submit their work to, and adjust not only their submission but also their reading strategies accordingly. On the other hand, much has been written about the negative effects of institutionalizing journal rank as an impact measure. So far, contributions to the debate concerning the limitations of journal rank as a scientific impact assessment tool have either lacked data, or relied on only a few studies. In this review, we present the most recent and pertinent data on the consequences of our current scholarly communication system with respect to various measures of scientific quality (such as utility/citations, methodological soundness, expert ratings or retractions). These data corroborate previous hypotheses: using journal rank as an assessment tool is bad scientific practice. Moreover, the data lead us to argue that any journal rank (not only the currently-favored Impact Factor) would have this negative impact. Therefore, we suggest that abandoning journals altogether, in favor of a library-based scholarly communication system, will ultimately be necessary. This new system will use modern information technology to vastly improve the filter, sort and discovery functions of the current journal system.},

abstract = {Background
Digital networks, mobile devices, and the possibility of mining the ever-increasing amount of digital traces that we leave behind in our daily activities are changing the way we can approach the study of human and social interactions. Large-scale datasets, however, are mostly available for collective and statistical behaviors, at coarse granularities, while high-resolution data on person-to-person interactions are generally limited to relatively small groups of individuals. Here we present a scalable experimental framework for gathering real-time data resolving face-to-face social interactions with tunable spatial and temporal granularities.

Methods and Findings
We use active Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) devices that assess mutual proximity in a distributed fashion by exchanging low-power radio packets. We analyze the dynamics of person-to-person interaction networks obtained in three high-resolution experiments carried out at different orders of magnitude in community size. The data sets exhibit common statistical properties and lack of a characteristic time scale from 20 seconds to several hours. The association between the number of connections and their duration shows an interesting super-linear behavior, which indicates the possibility of defining super-connectors both in the number and intensity of connections.

Conclusions
Taking advantage of scalability and resolution, this experimental framework allows the monitoring of social interactions, uncovering similarities in the way individuals interact in different contexts, and identifying patterns of super-connector behavior in the community. These results could impact our understanding of all phenomena driven by face-to-face interactions, such as the spreading of transmissible infectious diseases and information.},

abstract = {In most organisms, clamp loaders catalyze both the loading of sliding clamps onto DNA and their removal. How these opposing activities are regulated during assembly of the DNA polymerase holoenzyme remains unknown. By utilizing FRET to monitor protein-DNA interactions, we examined assembly of the human holoenzyme. The results indicate that assembly proceeds in a stepwise manner. The clamp loader (RFC) loads a sliding clamp (PCNA) onto a primer/template junction but remains transiently bound to the DNA. Unable to slide away, PCNA re-engages with RFC and is unloaded. In the presence of polymerase (pol$\delta$), loaded PCNA is captured from DNA-bound RFC which subsequently dissociates, leaving behind the holoenzyme. These studies suggest that the unloading activity of RFC maximizes the utilization of PCNA by inhibiting the build-up of free PCNA on DNA in the absence of polymerase and recycling limited PCNA to keep up with ongoing replication.

abstract = {A large body of work has been devoted to identifying community structure in networks. A community is often though of as a set of nodes that has more connections between its members than to the remainder of the network. In this paper, we characterize as a function of size the statistical and structural properties of such sets of nodes. We define the network community profile plot, which characterizes the best possible communityaccording to the conductance measureover a wide range of size scales, and we study over 70 large sparse real-world networks taken from a wide range of application domains. Our results suggest a significantly more refined picture of community structure in large real-world networks than has been appreciated previously. Our most striking finding is that in nearly every network dataset we examined, we observe tight but almost trivial communities at very small scales, and at larger size scales, the best possible communities gradually blend inwith the rest of the network and thus become less community-like. This behavior is not explained, even at a qualitative level, by any of the commonly-used network generation models. Moreover, this behavior is exactly the opposite of what one would expect based on experience with and intuition from expander graphs, from graphs that are well-embeddable in a low-dimensional structure, and from small social networks that have served as testbeds of community detection algorithms. We have found, however, that a generative model, in which new edges are added via an iterative forest fire burning process, is able to produce graphs exhibiting a network community structure similar to our observations.},

However, recent progress in applying the tools of science to understand science itself has been unprecedented because only recently has there been access to high-volume and high-quality data sets of scientific output (e.g., publications, patents, grants) and computers and algorithms capable of handling this enormous stream of data. This article reviews major work on models that aim to capture and recreate the structure and dynamics of scientific evolution. We then introduce a general process model that simultaneously grows coauthor and paper citation networks. The statistical and dynamic properties of the networks generated by this model are validated against a 20-year data set of articles published in PNAS. Systematic deviations from a power law distribution of citations to papers are well fit by a model that incorporates a partitioning of authors and papers into topics, a bias for authors to cite recent papers, and a tendency for authors to cite papers cited by papers that they have read. In this TARL model (for topics, aging, and recursive linking), the number of topics is linearly related to the clustering coefficient of the simulated paper citation network.},

For URLs in del.icio.us, we predicted tags based on page text, anchor text, surrounding hosts, and other tags applied to the URL. We found an entropy-based metric which captures the generality of a particular tag and informs an analysis of how well that tag can be predicted. We also found that tag-based association rules can produce very high-precision predictions as well as giving deeper understanding into the relationships between tags. Our results have implications for both the study of tagging systems as potential information retrieval tools, and for the design of such systems.},

Usage Impact Factor rankings are calculated on the basis of a large-scale usage data set recorded for the California State University system from 2003 to 2005. The resulting journal rankings are then compared to Thomson Scientific's ISI Impact Factor which is used as a baseline indicator of general impact.

Computers will have increasingly many cores (processors), but there is still no good programming framework for these architectures, and thus no simple and unified way for machine learning to take advantage of the potential speed up. In this paper, we develop a broadly ap- plicable parallel programming method, one that is easily applied to many different learning algorithms. Our work is in distinct contrast to the tradition in machine learning of designing (often ingenious) ways to speed up a single algorithm at a time. Specifically, we showthat algorithms that fit the Statistical Query model 15 can be written in a certain summation form, which allows them to be easily par- allelized on multicore computers. We adapt Googles map-reduce 7 paradigm to demonstrate this parallel speed up technique on a variety of learning algorithms including locally weighted linear regression (LWLR), k-means, logistic regres- sion (LR), naive Bayes (NB), SVM, ICA, PCA, gaussian discriminant analysis (GDA), EM, and backpropagation (NN). Our experimental results show basically linear speedup with an increasing number of processors.},

abstract = {Many practical computing problems concern large graphs. Standard examples include the Web graph and various social networks. The scale of these graphs - in some cases billions of vertices, trillions of edges - poses challenges to their efficient processing. In this paper we present a computational model suitable for this task. Programs are expressed as a sequence of iterations, in each of which a vertex can receive messages sent in the previous iteration, send messages to other vertices, and modify its own state and that of its outgoing edges or mutate graph topology. This vertex-centric approach is flexible enough to express a broad set of algorithms. The model has been designed for efficient, scalable and fault-tolerant implementation on clusters of thousands of commodity computers, and its implied synchronicity makes reasoning about programs easier. Distribution-related details are hidden behind an abstract API. The result is a framework for processing large graphs that is expressive and easy to program.},

At present, the disease is incurable and the molecular pathophysiology of DD is unknown. Surgery remains the most commonly used treatment for DD, but this requires extensive postoperative therapy and is associated with high rates of recurrence. Over the past decades, more indepth exploration of the molecular basis of DD has raised the hopes of developing new treatment modalities. This paper reviews the clinical presentation and molecular pathophysiology of this disease, as well as current and emerging treatment. It also explores the implications of new findings in the laboratory for future treatment.},

abstract = {The social media website last.fm provides a detailed snapshot of what its users in hundreds of cities listen to each week. After suitably normalizing this data, we use it to test three hypotheses related to the geographic flow of music. The first is that although many of the most popular artists are listened to around the world, music preferences are closely related to nationality, language, and geographic location. We find support for this hypothesis, with a couple of minor, yet interesting, exceptions. Our second hypothesis is that some cities are consistently early adopters of new music (and early to snub stale music). To test this hypothesis, we adapt a method previously used to detect the leadership networks present in flocks of birds. We find empirical support for the claim that a similar leadership network exists among cities, and this finding is the main contribution of the paper. Finally, we test the hypothesis that large cities tend to be ahead of smaller cities-we find only weak support for this hypothesis.},

This is hampered by a lack of any means for managing and communicating co-references. We have therefore developed an ontology and framework for the exploration and resolution of potential co-references, in the semantic web at large, that allow the user to a) discover and record uniquely identifying attributes b) interface candidates with and create pipelines of other systems for reference management c) record identified duplicates in a usable and retrievable manner, and d) provide a consistent reference service for accessing them. This paper describes this ontology and a framework of web services designed to support and utilise it.},

abstract = {The perspective that behavior is often driven by unconscious determinants has become widespread in social psychology. Bargh, Chen, and Burrows' (1996) famous study, in which participants unwittingly exposed to the stereotype of age walked slower when exiting the laboratory, was instrumental in defining this perspective. Here, we present two experiments aimed at replicating the original study. Despite the use of automated timing methods and a larger sample, our first experiment failed to show priming. Our second experiment was aimed at manipulating the beliefs of the experimenters: Half were led to think that participants would walk slower when primed congruently, and the other half was led to expect the opposite. Strikingly, we obtained a walking speed effect, but only when experimenters believed participants would indeed walk slower. This suggests that both priming and experimenters' expectations are instrumental in explaining the walking speed effect. Further, debriefing was suggestive of awareness of the primes. We conclude that unconscious behavioral priming is real, while real, involves mechanisms different from those typically assumed to cause the effect.},

abstract = {Rtation is a study of scientific collaboration at the Center for Embedded Networked Sensing (CENS), a modern, multi-disciplinary, distributed laboratory involved in sensor network research. By use of survey research and network analysis, this dissertation examines the collaborative ecology of CENS in terms of three networks of interaction: co-authorship of scholarly publications, communication activity on mailing lists, and interpersonal acquaintanceship. This study exposes the topology, structure, and evolution of these networks in relation with the disciplinary and institutional arrangements of CENS. Findings indicate that CENS collaboration networks have fluid, non-cliquish, small-world topologies, and are free of prestige-based mechanisms. Further analysis reveals that structural communities in the co-authorship and acquaintanceship networks overlap considerably. They also exhibit little disciplinary and institutional diversity locally, although CENS becomes more inter-disciplinary over time. Overall, results of the structural and evolutionary analyses point to the importance of interpersonal relationships for accomplishing scientific work in distributed environments.},

abstract = {We consider the problem of max-min fair allocation of indivisible goods. Our focus will be on the restricted version of the problem in which there are m items, each of which associated with a non-negative value. There are also n players and each player is only interested in some of the items. The goal is to distribute the items between the players such that the least happy person is as happy as possible, i.e. one wants to maximize the minimum of the sum of the values of the items given to any player. This problem is also known as the Santa Claus problem 3. Feige 9 proves that the integrality gap of a certain configuration LP, described by Bansal and Sviridenko 3, is bounded from below by some (unspecified) constant. This gives an efficient way to estimate the optimum value of the problem within a constant factor. However, the proof in 9 is nonconstructive: it uses the Lovasz local lemma and does not provide a polynomial time algorithm for finding an allocation. In this paper, we take a different approach to this problem, based upon local search techniques for finding perfectmatchings in certain classes of hypergraphs. As a result, we prove that the integrality gap of the configuration LP is bounded by 1 does provide a local search algorithm which finds the corresponding allocation, but this algorithm is not known to converge to a local optimum in a polynomial number of steps. 5 .

abstract = {The words real, really and pretend are used in developmental research paradigms to reflect both the notions of 'authenticity' (in pretense-reality and appearance-reality research) and 'existence' (in fantasy-reality research). The current study explored whether children also expressed these notions in their everyday uses of real, really, and pretend. Mothers were interviewed and kept diary records, resulting in data for a younger group of children (2- to 3-year-olds, N = 80) and an older group (4- to 7-year-olds, N = 101). Utterances were analysed according to different uses of the target words and the topic of conversation in which they occurred. The words real, really, and pretend were used by both the younger and older age groups predominantly to consider the authenticity of things around them. Expression of the notion of existence was less common, particularly among the younger children. The implications of these findings are discussed in relation to children's performance in experimental studies, particularly those that intend to question children's understanding of the fantasy-reality distinction.

That Santa Claus appears to be only inconsistently represented as having all five requisite features Santa has failed to develop a community of true believers and cult.

abstract = {Many researchers have conducted studies on consumers to understand various aspects of Web site credibility. However, some consumers may not be well equipped to make informed decisions about the accuracy of information in technical fields such as health or finance. In fact, previous research in other mediums showed that consumers have had mixed results when judging credibility of information. Given the varying results of previous studies of consumer credibility assessments, we are left wondering whether consumers' credibility evaluations of Web sites are correct. These evaluations are increasingly important as people use the Web today to carry out a variety of vital tasks and research. Consumers are faced with important decisions about the information sources that they choose to believe for making important health or financial decisions. Do these everyday people know which Web sites are really credible, especially in vital areas such as finance and health? What do industry experts say about the credibility of sites in their fields? And, finally, how do the experts' assessments compare to how the average person decides which sites to trust? To answer these credibility-related questions, Sliced Bread Design and Consumer Reports WebWatch produced this expert study, titled Experts vs. Online Consumers: A Comparative Credibility Study of Health and Finance Web Sites, in collaboration with Stanford University's Persuasive Technology Lab (Stanford PTL). As a usability and interaction design agency, Sliced Bread Design, LLC is interested in understanding how to create ethical online experiences that communicate credibility to their users. Consumer Reports WebWatch, which commissioned this study, has the goal to investigate, inform, and improve the credibility of information published on the World Wide Web. Due to these shared goals, the two organizations decided to embark on a study of how health and finance experts judge the credibility of Web sites within their domains of expertise. This expert study was launched jointly with a parallel, consumer-focused study, How Do People Evaluate a Web Site's Credibility? Results from a Large Study, conducted by the Stanford PTL and Consumer Reports WebWatch, which asked over 2,600 average people to rate the credibility of Web sites in 10 content areas. Our study then compared how experts and consumers evaluated the same health and finance sites to understand if and how consumers failed in their assessments. By comparing the expert and consumer evaluations, we hoped to identify any gaps in consumer education and begin to design guidelines for improving consumer understanding of online credibility. Furthermore, by studying experts in two diverse fields health and finance we aimed to learn about field-specific credibility in order to inform Web design guidelines and consumer education needs.},

We subsequently asked them to evaluate the credibility of the Web page and posed multiple-choice questions regarding the content of the pages. 137 completed responses were included for analysis. Our results show that the presentation of awards has no significant effect on the credibility or retention of health information on a Web page. Significantly, the highly educated participants in our study found inaccurate and misleading information on shark cartilage to be slightly believable.},

A combination of factors affects such credibility such as the provider, content, aesthetics, accessibility and solution of technical problems. The aesthetics of a web site can affect a users first impressions of credibility. Experiments have shown that users can judge a web sites credibility in as little as 3.42 seconds merely on the basis of its aesthetic appeal. But what are the aesthetic factors that influence immediate judgment on web credibility? A study was conducted to ascertain these factors; first a framework of factors was suggested to develop a method focusing on the users actual perceptions in judging credibility based on aesthetics. This was done with 30 subjects viewing 13 pairs of images of recruitment agency web sites. Unity in design with its elements of balance, harmony, contrast and dominance was found to be an effective aesthetic factor resulting in immediate judgments on web credibility. These factors were presented for beginner web designers in online tutorials. This work is a result of MSc project.},

As the Web becomes a part of people's everyday lives-booking travel, finding health information, buying products - there is a growing need to help people figure out whether a Web site is credible or not: Can I trust the information on this site? Can I trust in the services this site describes? As part of the Stanford University Persuasive Technology Lab's mission since 1998, the team has investigated what causes people to believe - or not believe - what they find online. Similarly, Consumer WebWatch, which commissioned this study, has the goal to investigate, inform, and improve the credibility of information published on the World Wide Web. Consumer WebWatch wanted to investigate whether consumers actually perform the necessary credibility checks-and-balances while online that they said they did in an earlier national poll (e.g., read privacy policy pages with at least some frequency.) These shared missions created a nexus between the two organizations, which led to collaboration on what we believe to be the largest Web credibility project to date. The resulting consumer-driven study titled, How Do People Evaluate a Web Site's Credibility? Results from a Large Study invited more than 2,600 average people to rate the credibility of Web sites in 10 content areas. This study was launched jointly with a parallel, expert-focused project conducted by Sliced Bread Design, LLC. In the expert study titled, Experts vs. Online Consumers: A Comparative Credibility Study of Health and Finance Web Sites, 15 health and finance experts were asked to assess the credibility of the same industry-specific sites as those reviewed by the Stanford PTL consumers. About These Joint Studies Stanford Persuasive Technology Lab: In this study, 2,684 people evaluated the credibility of two live Web sites randomly assigned from one of 10 content categories (e-commerce, entertainment, finance, health, news, nonprofit, opinion or review, search engines, sports, and travel.) A total of 100 sites were assessed. We gathered the comments people wrote (2,440 in all) about each site's credibility and analyzed these comments to track which features of a Web site were noticed (or went unnoticed) when consumers evaluated credibility online. (See Appendix A for a complete list of Web sites selected for this study.) Sliced Bread Design: In this study, 15 experts from the health and financial fields were asked to assess the credibility of sites in their respective areas. A total of 8 health and 7 finance experts visited the same sites (10 health sites or 10 finance sites) as the consumers in the Stanford PTL study. They were asked to rank from 1-to-10 the credibility of the sites specific to their area of expertise, as well as provide detailed written assessments of each site under review. (See Appendix B in the Sliced Bread Design study for a list of the expert participants and brief bios.) Key Findings We found that when people assessed a real Web site's credibility they did not use rigorous criteria, a contrast to the findings of Consumer WebWatch's earlier national survey, A Matter of Trust: What Users Want From Web Sites, released April 16, 2002. In this poll of 1,500 U.S. adult Internet users, people claimed that certain elements were vital to a Web site's credibility (e.g., having a privacy policy). But this most recent Web-based credibility study showed that people rarely used these rigorous criteria when evaluating credibility (e.g., they almost never referred to a site's privacy policy.) We found a mismatch, as in other areas of life, between what people say is important and what they actually do. The data showed that the average consumer paid far more attention to the superficial aspects of a site, such as visual cues, than to its content. For example, nearly half of all consumers (or 46.1{\%}) in the study assessed the credibility of sites based in part on the appeal of the overall visual design of a site, including layout, typography, font size and color schemes. This reliance on a site's overall visual appeal to gauge its credibility occurred more often with some categories of sites then others. Consumer credibility-related comments about visual design issues occurred with more frequency with finance (54.6{\%}), search engines (52.6{\%}), travel (50.5{\%}), and e-commerce sites (46.2{\%}), and with less frequency when assessing health (41.8{\%}), news (39.6{\%}), and nonprofit (39.4{\%}) sites. In comparison, the parallel Sliced Bread Design study revealed that health and finance experts were far less concerned about the surface aspects of these industry-specific types of sites and more concerned about the breadth, depth, and quality of a site's information. Topics Our Analysts Did Not Find Although our analysis probably did not reveal all issues related to the credibility of the sites in this study, there were topics we looked for in our analysis but did not find. Smaller numbers of consumers registered credibility assessment comments that related to Consumer WebWatch's five general guidelines for improving credibility on the Web: Identity, Advertising and Sponsorships, Customer Service, Corrections, and Privacy. As we examined the 2,440 comments about credibility, we found that less than 10 percent of the participants' comments (or 8.8{\%}) referred to the identity of the site or its operator. Nearly 7 percent (or 6.4{\%}) of consumers in our study made comments about a site's customer service or related policies when assessing credibility. Nearly 3 percent (or 2.3{\%}) of consumer comments referred to a site's sponsorships when assessing credibility - whether perceived as positive or negative in nature. We found that people mentioned privacy policies in less than 1{\%} of their comments. We also looked for comments about correcting false or misleading information and found no comments along these lines. These last two issues apparently did not affect how our participants evaluated the credibility of Web sites in this study. Our result among consumers about the prominence of site design and overall look was not what we had hoped to find. Participants seemed to make their credibility-based decisions about the people or organization behind the site based upon the site's overall visual appeal. We had hoped to see people use more rigorous evaluation strategies while assessing sites. This result indicates that Consumer WebWatch, along with librarians and information professionals, must increase efforts to educate online consumers so they evaluate the Web sites they visit more carefully and make better educated decisions, particularly when that it could adversely affect their pocketbooks or health situations.

abstract = {Quantum states are the key mathematical objects in quantum theory. It is therefore surprising that physicists have been unable to agree on what a quantum state represents. There are at least two opposing schools of thought, each almost as old as quantum theory itself. One is that a pure state is a physical property of system, much like position and momentum in classical mechanics. Another is that even a pure state has only a statistical significance, akin to a probability distribution in statistical mechanics. Here we show that, given only very mild assumptions, the statistical interpretation of the quantum state is inconsistent with the predictions of quantum theory. This result holds even in the presence of small amounts of experimental noise, and is therefore amenable to experimental test using present or near-future technology. If the predictions of quantum theory are confirmed, such a test would show that distinct quantum states must correspond to physically distinct states of reality.},

abstract = {A new method for automatic indexing and retrieval is described. The approach is to take advantage of implicit higher-order structure in the association of terms with documents (“semantic structure”) in order to improve the detection of relevant documents on the basis of terms found in queries. The particular technique used is singular-value decomposition, in which a large term by document matrix is decomposed into a set of ca. 100 or-thogonal factors from which the original matrix can be approximated by linear combination. Documents are represented by ca. 100 item vectors of factor weights. Queries are represented as pseudo-document vectors formed from weighted combinations of terms, and documents with supra-threshold cosine values are re-turned. initial tests find this completely automatic method for retrieval to be promising.},

The main challenge in this task is designing a function that can resolve when a pair of records refer to the same entity in spite of various data inconsistencies. Most existing systems use hand-coded functions. One way to overcome the tedium of hand-coding is to train a classifier to distinguish between duplicates and non-duplicates. The success of this method critically hinges on being able to provide a covering and challenging set of training pairs that bring out the subtlety of the deduplication function. This is non-trivial because it requires manually searching for various data inconsistencies between any two records spread apart in large lists. We present our design of a learning-based deduplication system that uses a novel method of interactively discovering challenging training pairs using active learning. Our experiments on real-life datasets show that active learning signicantly reduces the number of instances needed to achieve high accuracy. We investigate various design issues that arise in building a system to provide interactive response, fast convergence, and interpretable output.},

In this paper, we summarize and extend our work on different aspects of this branch of Web 2.0 research, demonstrated and evaluated within our own social bookmark and publication sharing system BibSonomy, which is currently among the three most popular systems of its kind. We structure this presentation along the different interaction phases of a user with our system, coupling the relevant research questions of each phase with the corresponding implementation issues. This approach reveals in a systematic fashion important aspects and results of the broad bandwidth of folksonomy research like capturing of emergent semantics, spam detection, ranking algorithms, analogies to search engine log data, personalized tag recommendations and information extraction techniques. We conclude that when integrating a real-life application like BibSonomy into research, certain constraints have to be considered; but in general, the tight interplay between our scientific work and the running system has made BibSonomy a valuable platform for demonstrating and evaluating Web 2.0 research.},

@article{Huminiecki2010,
abstract = {BACKGROUND :Whole genome duplication (WGD) is a special case of gene duplication, observed rarely in animals, whereby all genes duplicate simultaneously through polyploidisation. Two rounds of WGD (2R-WGD) occurred at the base of vertebrates, giving rise to an enormous wave of genetic novelty, but a systematic analysis of functional consequences of this event has not yet been performed. RESULTS :We show that 2R-WGD affected an overwhelming majority (74{\%}) of signalling genes, in particular developmental pathways involving receptor tyrosine kinases, Wnt and transforming growth factor-beta ligands, G protein-coupled receptors and the apoptosis pathway. 2R-retained genes, in contrast to tandem duplicates, were enriched in protein interaction domains and multifunctional signalling modules of Ras and mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades. 2R-WGD had a fundamental impact on the cell-cycle machinery, redefined molecular building blocks of the neuronal synapse, and was formative for vertebrate brains. We investigated 2R-associated nodes in the context of the human signalling network, as well as in an inferred ancestral pre-2R (AP2R) network, and found that hubs (particularly involving negative regulation) were preferentially retained, with high connectivity driving retention. Finally, microarrays and proteomics demonstrated a trend for gradual paralog expression divergence independent of the duplication mechanism, but inferred ancestral expression states suggested preferential subfunctionalisation among 2R-ohnologs (2ROs). CONCLUSIONS :The 2R event left an indelible imprint on vertebrate signalling and the cell cycle. We show that 2R-WGD preferentially retained genes are associated with higher organismal complexity (for example, locomotion, nervous system, morphogenesis), while genes associated with basic cellular functions (for example, translation, replication, splicing, recombination; with the notable exception of cell cycle) tended to be excluded. 2R-WGD set the stage for the emergence of key vertebrate functional novelties (such as complex brains, circulatory system, heart, bone, cartilage, musculature and adipose tissue). A full explanation of the impact of 2R on evolution, function and the flow of information in vertebrate signalling networks is likely to have practical consequences for regenerative medicine, stem cell therapies and cancer treatment.},

abstract = {The High-Z Supernova Search is an international collaboration to discover and monitor type Ia supernovae (SN Ia) at z {\textgreater} 0.2 with the aim of measuring cosmic deceleration and global curvature. Our collaboration has pursued a basic understanding of supernovae in the nearby Universe, discovering and observing a large sample of objects, and developing methods to measure accurate distances with SN Ia. This paper describes the extension of this program to z geq 0.2, outlining our search techniques and follow-up program. We have devised high-throughput filters which provide accurate two-color restframe B and V light curves of SN Ia, enabling us to produce precise, extinction-corrected luminosity distances in the range {\$}0.25 {\textless} z {\textless} 0.55. Sources of systematic error from K-corrections, extinction, selection effects, and evolution are investigated, and their effects estimated. We present photometric and spectral observations of SN 1995K, our program's first supernova, and use the data to obtain a precise measurement of the luminosity distance to the z=0.479 host galaxy. This object, when combined with a nearby sample of SN, yields an estimate for the matter density of the Universe of OmegaM = -0.2{\^{}}+1.0-0.8 if OmegaLambda = 0. For a spatially flat universe composed of normal matter and a cosmological constant, we find OmegaM = 0.4{\^{}}+0.5-0.4, OmegaLambda = 0.6{\^{}}+0.4-0.5. We demonstrate that with a sample of sim 30 objects, we should be able to determine relative luminosity distances over the range {\$}0 {\textless} z{\textless} 0.5 with sufficient precision to measure OmegaM with an uncertainty of pm 0.2.},

abstract = {The High-z Supernova Search Team has discovered and observed 8 new supernovae in the redshift interval z=0.3-1.2. These independent observations, confirm the result of Riess et al. (1998a) and Perlmutter et al. (1999) that supernova luminosity distances imply an accelerating universe. More importantly, they extend the redshift range of consistently observed SN Ia to z{\~{}}1, where the signature of cosmological effects has the opposite sign of some plausible systematic effects. Consequently, these measurements not only provide another quantitative confirmation of the importance of dark energy, but also constitute a powerful qualitative test for the cosmological origin of cosmic acceleration. We find a rate for SN Ia of 1.4+/-0.5E-04 h{\^{}}3/Mpc{\^{}}3/yr at a mean redshift of 0.5. We present distances and host extinctions for 230 SN Ia. These place the following constraints on cosmological quantities: if the equation of state parameter of the dark energy is w=-1, then H0 t0 = 0.96+/-0.04, and Ol - 1.4 Om = 0.35+/-0.14. Including the constraint of a flat Universe, we find Om = 0.28+/-0.05, independent of any large-scale structure measurements. Adopting a prior based on the 2dF redshift survey constraint on Om and assuming a flat universe, we find that the equation of state parameter of the dark energy lies in the range -1.48-1, we obtain w{\textless}-0.73 at 95{\%} confidence. These constraints are similar in precision and in value to recent results reported using the WMAP satellite, also in combination with the 2dF redshift survey.},

abstract = {Over the past decade, supernovae have emerged as some of the most powerful tools for measuring extragalactic distances. A well developed physical understanding of type II supernovae allow them to be used to measure distances independent of the extragalactic distance scale. Type Ia supernovae are empirical tools whose precision and intrinsic brightness make them sensitive probes of the cosmological expansion. Both types of supernovae are consistent with a Hubble Constant within {\~{}}10{\%} of H0 = 70 km/s/Mpc. Two teams have used type Ia supernovae to trace the expansion of the Universe to a look-back time more than 60{\%} of the age of the Universe. These observations show an accelerating Universe which is currently best explained by a cosmological constant or other form of dark energy with an equation of state near w = p/rho = -1. While there are many possible remaining systematic effects, none appears large enough to challenge these current results. Future experiments are planned to better characterize the equation of state of the dark energy leading to the observed acceleration by observing hundreds or even thousands of objects. These experiments will need to carefully control systematic errors to ensure future conclusions are not dominated by effects unrelated to cosmology.},

Here I show how disciplines with a high likelihood of nepotism can be detected using standard statistical techniques based on shared last names among professors. As an example, I analyze the set of all 61,340 Italian academics. I find that nepotism is prominent in Italy, with particular disciplinary sectors being detected as especially problematic. Out of 28 disciplines, 9 – accounting for more than half of Italian professors – display a significant paucity of last names. Moreover, in most disciplines a clear north-south trend emerges, with likelihood of nepotism increasing with latitude. Even accounting for the geographic clustering of last names, I find that for many disciplines the probability of name-sharing is boosted when professors work in the same institution or sub-discipline. Using these techniques policy makers can target cuts and funding in order to promote fair practices.},

The system continuously analyzes documents reported from over 1700 RSS feeds, classifies them for topical relevance and plots them onto a Google map using geocoded information. The background knowledge for bridging the gap between Layman's terms and formal-coding systems is contained in the freely available BioCaster ontology which includes information in eight languages focused on the epidemiological role of pathogens as well as geographical locations with their latitudes/longitudes. The system consists of four main stages: topic classification, named entity recognition (NER), disease/location detection and event recognition. Higher order event analysis is used to detect more precisely specified warning signals that can then be notified to registered users via email alerts. Evaluation of the system for topic recognition and entity identification is conducted on a gold standard corpus of annotated news articles. AVAILABILITY: The BioCaster map and ontology are freely available via a web portal at http://www.biocaster.org.},

What is needed is a test of the cognitive "type", as manifested through a number of exemplary tokens, in order to confirm that the cognitive type is able to produce the context of intelligent behavior presupposed by tests such as the "TT" and "TTT".},

abstract = {Movement, or mobility, is key to the accessibility, design, and usability of many websites. While some peripheral mobility issues have been addressed few have centred on the mobility problems of visually impaired users. We use our past work to address these issues and derive mobility heuristics from mobility models, use these heuristics to place mobility objects within a web page, and describe the construction of a prototype mobility instrument, in the form of a Netscape plug-in, to process these objects. Specifically, we likened web use to travelling in a virtual space, compared it to travelling in a physical space, and introduced the idea of mobility - the ease of travel - as opposed to travel opportunity. Our hypothesis is that travel and mobility within the web mirrors travel and mobility within real-world environments. We suggest that the Web community has typically concentrated on navigation and or orientation rather than the whole travel experience, and that this neglect is crucial when dealing with browsing by visually impaired users. We therefore extend the definition of travel to mean: confident navigation and orientation with purpose, ease and accuracy within an environment.},

We prove that in the offline version of Tetris, it is NP-complete to maximize the number of cleared rows, maximize the number of tetrises (quadruples of rows simultaneously filled and cleared), minimize the maximum height of an occupied square, or maximize the number of pieces placed before the game ends. We furthermore show the extreme inapproximability of the first and last of these objectives to within a factor of p{\^{}}(1-epsilon), when given a sequence of p pieces, and the inapproximability of the third objective to within a factor of (2 - epsilon), for any epsilon{\textgreater}0. Our results hold under several variations on the rules of Tetris, including different models of rotation, limitations on player agility, and restricted piece sets.},

@article{Holmes2010,
abstract = {Background: Flashbacks (intrusive memories of a traumatic event) are the hallmark feature of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, however preventative interventions are lacking. Tetris may offer a cognitive vaccine 1 against flashback development after trauma exposure. We previously reported that playing the computer game Tetris soon after viewing traumatic material reduced flashbacks compared to no-task 1. However, two criticisms need to be addressed for clinical translation: (1) Would all games have this effect via distraction/enjoyment, or might some games even be harmful? (2) Would effects be found if administered several hours post-trauma? Accordingly, we tested Tetris versus an alternative computer game Pub Quiz which we hypothesized not to be helpful (Experiments 1 and 2), and extended the intervention interval to 4 hours (Experiment 2). Methodology/Principal Findings: The trauma film paradigm was used as an experimental analog for flashback development in healthy volunteers. In both experiments, participants viewed traumatic film footage of death and injury before completing one of the following: (1) no-task control condition (2) Tetris or (3) Pub Quiz. Flashbacks were monitored for 1 week. Experiment 1: 30 min after the traumatic film, playing Tetris led to a significant reduction in flashbacks compared to no-task control, whereas Pub Quiz led to a significant increase in flashbacks. Experiment 2: 4 hours post-film, playing Tetris led to a significant reduction in flashbacks compared to no-task control, whereas Pub Quiz did not. Conclusions/Significance: First, computer games can have differential effects post-trauma, as predicted by a cognitive science formulation of trauma memory. In both Experiments, playing Tetris post-trauma film reduced flashbacks. Pub Quiz did not have this effect, even increasing flashbacks in Experiment 1. Thus not all computer games are beneficial or merely distracting post-trauma - some may be harmful. Second, the beneficial effects of Tetris are retained at 4 hours post-trauma. Clinically, this delivers a feasible time-window to administer a post-trauma cognitive vaccine.},

abstract = {Could androids use movements to build relationships'? For people, relationships are created with the help of behaviour-shaping norms, which infants begin to discover and manipulate by the third month. To build relationships, machines can also learn to exploit human reactions in real-time decision-making. In the video game Tetris, for example, affect co-opts computer-generated patterns to simplify cognitive tasks: norms mediate what Kirsh and Maglio (Cognitive Sci., 18, pp. 513-549, 1994) term epistemic actions, which allow implicit knowledge to shape key pressing in ways that, given past games, are likely to be informative and valuable. Expert players act to change their cognitive states by allowing the game's higher-level states to constrain their lower-level actions. Since this process enables the development of expertise, we might expect it to be widespread; but it seems marginal in hamadryas baboons, although they use affect and complex norms. In humans, by contrast, infants use adults as cognitive resources in developing their epistemic abilities. This has engineering implications for android designers. Since androids can elicit epistemic actions, engineers need to develop an affect sensitive inter-face. If successful at this, even rudimentary co-action may prompt people to report experiencing androids as both making choices and violating expectations.},

abstract = {The amount of information contained in a piece of data can be measured by the effect this data has on its observer. Fundamentally, this effect is to transform the observer's prior beliefs into posterior beliefs, according to Bayes theorem. Thus the amount of information can be measured in a natural way by the distance (relative entropy) between the prior and posterior distributions of the observer over the available space of hypotheses. This facet of information, termed "surprise", is important in dynamic situations where beliefs change, in particular during learning and adaptation. Surprise can often be computed analytically, for instance in the case of distributions from the exponential family, or it can be numerically approximated. During sequential Bayesian learning, surprise decreases as the inverse of the number of training examples. Theoretical properties of surprise are discussed, in particular how it differs and complements Shannon's definition of information. A computer vision neural network architecture is then presented capable of computing surprise over images and video stimuli. Hypothesizing that surprising data ought to attract natural or artificial attention systems, the output of this architecture is used in a psychophysical experiment to analyze human eye movements in the presence of natural video stimuli. Surprise is found to yield robust performance at predicting human gaze (ROC-like ordinal dominance score approximately 0.7 compared to approximately 0.8 for human inter-observer repeatability, approximately 0.6 for simpler intensity contrast-based predictor, and 0.5 for chance). The resulting theory of surprise is applicable across different spatio-temporal scales, modalities, and levels of abstraction.},

abstract = {The presence of web-based communities is a distinctive signature of Web 2.0. The web-based feature means that information propagation within each community is highly facilitated, promoting complex collective dynamics in view of information exchange. In this work, we focus on a community of scientists and study, in particular, how the awareness of a scientific paper is spread. Our work is based on the web usage statistics obtained from the PLoS Article Level Metrics dataset compiled by PLoS. The cumulative number of HTML views was found to follow a long tail distribution which is reasonably well-fitted by a lognormal one. We modeled the diffusion of information by a random multiplicative process, and thus extracted the rates of information spread at different stages after the publication of a paper. We found that the spread of information displays two distinct decay regimes: a rapid downfall in the first month after publication, and a gradual power law decay afterwards. We identified these two regimes with two distinct driving processes: a short-term behavior driven by the fame of a paper, and a long-term behavior consistent with citation statistics. The patterns of information spread were found to be remarkably similar in data from different journals, but there are intrinsic differences for different types of web usage (HTML views and PDF downloads versus XML). These similarities and differences shed light on the theoretical understanding of different complex systems, as well as a better design of the corresponding web applications that is of high potential marketing impact.},

Finally, we analyze the user intentions associated at a community level and show how users with similar intentions connect with each other.},

Five experiments suggest that this limitation is often underappreciated, such that people tend to believe that they can communicate over e-mail more effectively than they actually can. Studies 4 and 5 further suggest that this overconfidence is born of egocentrism, the inherent difficulty of detaching oneself from one's own perspective when evaluating the perspective of someone else. Because e-mail communicators "hear" a statement differently depending on whether they intend to be, say, sarcastic or funny, it can be difficult to appreciate that their electronic audience may not.},

abstract = {Cosmic strings are predicted to form kinks and cusps that travel along the string at close to the speed of light. These disturbances are radiated away as highly beamed gravitational waves that produce a burst like pulse as the cone of emission sweeps past an observer. Gravitational wave detectors such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) and the Laser Interferometer Gravitational wave Observatory (LIGO) will be capable of detecting these bursts for a wide class of string models. Such a detection would illuminate the fields of string theory, cosmology, and relativity. Here we develop template based Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques that can efficiently detect and characterize the signals from cosmic string cusps. We estimate how well the signal parameters can be recovered by the advanced LIGO-Virgo network and the LISA detector using a combination of MCMC and Fisher matrix techniques. We also consider joint detections by the ground and space based instruments. We show that a parallel tempered MCMC approach can detect and characterize the signals from cosmic string cusps, and we demonstrate the utility of this approach on simulated data from the third round of Mock LISA Data Challenges (MLDCs).},

The nominal formation consists of three spacecraft in heliocentric orbits at 1 AU and trailing the Earth by twenty degrees. This configuration was chosen as a trade off to reduce the noise sources that will affect the instrument and to minimize the fuel to achieve the final orbit. We present equations for the nominal orbit design and discuss several different measures of performance for the LISA formation. All of the measures directly relate the formation dynamics to science performance. Also, constraints on the formation dynamics due to spacecraft and instrument limitations are discussed. Using the nominal solution as an initial guess, the formation is optimized using Sequential Quadratic Programming to maximize the performance while satisfying a set of nonlinear constraints. Optimal solutions are presented for each of the performance measures.},

This research evaluates the use of undo and erase events as indicators of critical incidents in Google SketchUp (a 3D-modeling application), measuring an indicator's usefulness by the numbers and types of usability problems discovered. We compared problems identified using undo and erase events to problems identified using the user-reported critical incident technique Hartson and Castillo 1998. In a within-subjects experiment with 35 participants, undo and erase episodes together revealed over 90{\%} of the problems rated as severe, several of which would not have been discovered by self-report alone. Moreover, problems found by all three methods were rated as significantly more severe than those identified by only a subset of methods. These results suggest that undo and erase events will serve as useful complements to user-reported critical incidents for low cost usability evaluation of creation-oriented applications like SketchUp.},

abstract = {Objective To understand belief in a specific scientific claim by studying the pattern of citations among papers stating it. Design A complete citation network was constructed from all PubMed indexed English literature papers addressing the belief that amyloid, a protein accumulated in the brain in Alzheimers disease, is produced by and injures skeletal muscle of patients with inclusion body myositis. Social network theory and graph theory were used to analyse this network. Main outcome measures Citation bias, amplification, and invention, and their effects on determining authority. Results The network contained 242 papers and 675 citations addressing the belief, with 220553 citation paths supporting it. Unfounded authority was established by citation bias against papers that refuted or weakened the belief; amplification, the marked expansion of the belief system by papers presenting no data addressing it; and forms of invention such as the conversion of hypothesis into fact through citation alone. Extension of this network into text within grants funded by the National Institutes of Health and obtained through the Freedom of Information Act showed the same phenomena present and sometimes used to justify requests for funding. Conclusion Citation is both an impartial scholarly method and a powerful form of social communication. Through distortions in its social use that include bias, amplification, and invention, citation can be used to generate information cascades resulting in unfounded authority of claims. Construction and analysis of a claim specific citation network may clarify the nature of a published belief system and expose distorted methods of social citation.},

abstract = {To the majority of people Einstein's theory is a complete mystery. Their attitude towards Einstein is like that of Mark Twain towards the writer of a work on mathematics: here was a man who had written an entire book of which Mark could not understand a single sentence. Einstein, therefore, is great in the public eye partly because he has made revolutionary discoveries which cannot be translated into the common tongue. We stand in proper awe of a man whose thoughts move on heights far beyond our range, whose achievements can be measured only by the few who are able to follow his reasoning and challenge his conclusions. There is, however, another side to his personality. It is revealed in the addresses, letters, and occasional writings brought together in this book. These fragments form a mosaic portrait of Einstein the man. Each one is, in a sense, complete in itself; it presents his views on some aspect of progress, education, peace, war, liberty, or other problems of universal interest. Their combined effect is to demonstrate that the Einstein we can all understand is no less great than the Einstein we take on trust.},

abstract = {Understanding the dynamics around rotating black holes is imperative to the success of the future gravitational wave observatories. Although integrable in principle, test particle orbits in the Kerr spacetime can also be elaborate, and while they have been studied extensively, classifying their general properties has been a challenge. This is the first in a series of papers that adopts a dynamical systems approach to the study of Kerr orbits, beginning with equatorial orbits. We define a taxonomy of orbits that hinges on a correspondence between periodic orbits and rational numbers. The taxonomy defines the entire dynamics, including aperiodic motion, since every orbit is in or near the periodic set. A remarkable implication of this periodic orbit taxonomy is that the simple precessing ellipse familiar from planetary orbits is not allowed in the strong-field regime. Instead, eccentric orbits trace out precessions of multi-leaf clovers in the final stages of inspiral. Furthermore, for any black hole, there is some point in the strong-field regime past which zoom-whirl behavior becomes unavoidable. Finally, we sketch the potential application of the taxonomy to problems of astrophysical interest, in particular its utility for computationally intensive gravitational wave calculations.},

abstract = {Gapped phases of noninteracting fermions, with and without charge conservation and time-reversal symmetry, are classified using Bott periodicity. The symmetry and spatial dimension determines a general universality class, which corresponds to one of the 2 types of complex and 8 types of real Clifford algebras. The phases within a given class are further characterized by a topological invariant, an element of some Abelian group that can be 0, Z, or Z2. The interface between two infinite phases with different topological numbers must carry some gapless mode. Topological properties of finite systems are described in terms of K-homology. This classification is robust with respect to disorder, provided electron states near the Fermi energy are absent or localized. In some cases (e.g., integer quantum Hall systems) the K-theoretic classification is stable to interactions, but a counterexample is also given.},

A model is developed to rationalize the ordering of the shells predicted by the generalized Madelung rule. This model is based on the introduction of an Hamiltonian, invariant under the q-deformed algebra Uq(so(D)), that breaks down the SO(D+1) dynamical symmetry of the hydrogen atom in D dimensions. The D=2 case (Flatland) is investigated with some details. It is shown that the neutral atoms and the (moderately) positive ions correspond to the values q=0.8 and q=1, respectively, of the deformation parameter q.},

abstract = {All leptons, quarks, and gauge bosons can be placed in the periodic table of elementary particles. The periodic table is derived from dualities of string theory and a Kaluza-Klein substructure for the six extra spatial dimensions. As a molecule is the composite of atoms with chemical bonds, a hadron is the composite of elementary particles with hadronic bonds. The masses of elementary particles and hadrons can be calculated using the periodic table with only four known constants: the number of the extra spatial dimensions in the superstring, the mass of electron, the mass of Z=B0, and the fine structure constant for the magnetic field. The calculated masses are in good agreement with the observed values. For examples, the calculated masses for the top quark, neutron, and pion are 176.5 GeV, 939.54MeV, and 135.01MeV in excellent agreement with the observed masses, 176 =B1 13 GeV, 939.57 MeV, and 134.98 MeV, respectively. The masses of 110 hadrons are calculated. The overall average difference between the calculated masses and the observed masses for all hadrons is 0.29 MeV. The periodic table of elementary particles provides the most comprehensive explanation and calculation for the masses of elementary particles and hadrons.},

In the obtained periodic table or in the reformed table (a cube-shaped periodic table), the proteinaceous amino acids not only have periodicity, but also occupy mirror-symmetrical positions with respect to the xy-plane. Moreover, the cube-shaped periodic table allows a partial explanation of non-standard genetic codes and some predictions about providing potential candidates for non-standard genetic codons to be discovered in the future. By making a new format of a two-dimensional periodic table for anticodons as the primary reference point, all of the anticodon pairing with multiple codons can be intimately related to a mirror-symmetrical arrangement of amino acids with relation to the yz-plane in the two-dimensional periodic table.},

The following two articles, reprinted from The Educator (1898), Vol. V, pp. 3-4 and pp. 38-44, capture Bell's thinking about sign language and its use in the classroom. Contrary to frequent claims, Bell does not demand "oral" training for all deaf children-even if he thinks it is the superior alternative-but does advocate for it for "the semi-deaf" and "the semi-mute." "In regard to the others," he writes, "I am not so sure." Although he clearly voices his support for oral methods and fingerspelling (the Rochester method) over sign language, Bell acknowledges the use and utility of signing in a carefully-crafted discussion that includes both linguistics and educational philosophy. In separating the language used at home from that in school and on the playground, Bell reveals a far more complex view of language learning by deaf children than he is often granted. (M.

abstract = {We present a full sky 100 micron map that is a reprocessed composite of the COBE/DIRBE and IRAS/ISSA maps, with the zodiacal foreground and confirmed point sources removed. Before using the ISSA maps, we remove the remaining artifacts from the IRAS scan pattern. Using the DIRBE 100 micron and 240 micron data, we have constructed a map of the dust temperature, so that the 100 micron map can be converted to a map proportional to dust column density. The result of these manipulations is a map with DIRBE-quality calibration and IRAS resolution. To generate the full sky dust maps, we must first remove zodiacal light contamination as well as a possible cosmic infrared background (CIB). This is done via a regression analysis of the 100 micron DIRBE map against the Leiden- Dwingeloo map of HI emission, with corrections for the zodiacal light via a suitable expansion of the DIRBE 25 micron flux. For the 100 micron map, no significant CIB is detected. In the 140 micron and 240 micron maps, where the zodiacal contamination is weaker, we detect the CIB at surprisingly high flux levels of 32 pm 13 nW/m{\^{}}2/sr at 140 micron, and 17 pm 4 nW/m{\^{}}2/sr at 240 micron (95{\%} confidence). This integrated flux is {\~{}}2 times that extrapolated from optical galaxies in the Hubble Deep Field. The primary use of these maps is likely to be as a new estimator of Galactic extinction. We demonstrate that the new maps are twice as accurate as the older Burstein-Heiles estimates in regions of low and moderate reddening. These dust maps will also be useful for estimating millimeter emission that contaminates CMBR experiments and for estimating soft X-ray absorption.},

Complex networks are gaining more and more importance as a reference model and are a powerful interpretation tool for many different kinds of natural, biological and social networks, where directed relationships and contextual belonging of nodes to many different communities is a matter of fact. This paper starts from the definition of modularity function, given by M. Newman to evaluate the goodness of network community decompositions, and extends it to the more general case of directed graphs with overlapping community structures. Interesting properties of the proposed extension are discussed, a method for finding overlapping communities is proposed and results of its application to benchmark case-studies are reported. We also propose a new dataset which could be used as a reference benchmark for overlapping community structures identification.},

The network consists of 2.5 million customers that have placed 810 millions of communications (phone calls and text messages) over a period of 6 months and for whom we have geographical home localization information. It is shown that the degree distribution in this network has a power-law degree distribution k{\^{}}-5 and that the probability that two customers are connected by a link follows a gravity model, i.e. decreases like d{\^{}}-2, where d is the distance between the customers. We also consider the geographical extension of communication triangles and we show that communication triangles are not only composed of geographically adjacent nodes but that they may extend over large distances. This last property is not captured by the existing models of geographical networks and in a last section we propose a new model that reproduces the observed property. Our model, which is based on the migration and on the local adaptation of agents, is then studied analytically and the resulting predictions are confirmed by computer simulations.},

Google is designed to crawl and index the Web efficiently and produce much more satisfying search results than existing systems. The prototype with a full text and hyperlink database of at least 24 million pages is available at http://google.stanford.edu/ To engineer a search engine is a challenging task. Search engines index tens to hundreds of millions of web pages involving a comparable number of distinct terms. They answer tens of millions of queries every day. Despite the importance of large-scale search engines on the web, very little academic research has been done on them. Furthermore, due to rapid advance in technology and web proliferation, creating a web search engine today is very different from three years ago. This paper provides an in-depth description of our large-scale web search engine - the first such detailed public description we know of to date. Apart from the problems of scaling traditional search techniques to data of this magnitude, there are new technical challenges involved with using the additional information present in hypertext to produce better search results. This paper addresses this question of how to build a practical large-scale system which can exploit the additional information present in hypertext. Also we look at the problem of how to effectively deal with uncontrolled hypertext collections where anyone can publish anything they want.},

We examine a large real-world data set: the NEC CiteSeer database, a linked network of {\textgreater}250,000 papers. Tracking changes over time requires a clustering algorithm that produces clusters stable under small perturbations of the input data. However, small perturbations of the CiteSeer data lead to significant changes to most of the clusters. One reason for this is that the order in which papers within communities are combined is somewhat arbitrary. However, certain subsets of papers, called natural communities, correspond to real structure in the CiteSeer database and thus appear in any clustering. By identifying the subset of clusters that remain stable under multiple clustering runs, we get the set of natural communities that we can track over time. We demonstrate that such natural communities allow us to identify emerging communities and track temporal changes in the underlying structure of our network data.},

abstract = {Graph vertices are often organized into groups that seem to live fairly independently of the rest of the graph, with which they share but a few edges, whereas the relationships between group members are stronger, as shown by the large number of mutual connections. Such groups of vertices, or communities, can be considered as independent compartments of a graph. Detecting communities is of great importance in sociology, biology and computer science, disciplines where systems are often represented as graphs. The task is very hard, though, both conceptually, due to the ambiguity in the definition of community and in the discrimination of different partitions and practically, because algorithms must find ``good'' partitions among an exponentially large number of them. Other complications are represented by the possible occurrence of hierarchies, i.e. communities which are nested inside larger communities, and by the existence of overlaps between communities, due to the presence of nodes belonging to more groups. All these aspects are dealt with in some detail and many methods are described, from traditional approaches used in computer science and sociology to recent techniques developed mostly within statistical physics.},

abstract = {The processes by which communities come together, attract new members, and develop over time is a central research issue in the social sciences - political movements, professional organizations, and religious denominations all provide fundamental examples of such communities. In the digital domain, on-line groups are becoming increasingly prominent due to the growth of community and social networking sites such as MySpace and LiveJournal. However, the challenge of collecting and analyzing large-scale time-resolved data on social groups and communities has left most basic questions about the evolution of such groups largely unresolved: what are the structural features that influence whether individuals will join communities, which communities will grow rapidly, and how do the overlaps among pairs of communities change over time.Here we address these questions using two large sources of data: friendship links and community membership on LiveJournal, and co-authorship and conference publications in DBLP. Both of these datasets provide explicit user-defined communities, where conferences serve as proxies for communities in DBLP. We study how the evolution of these communities relates to properties such as the structure of the underlying social networks. We find that the propensity of individuals to join communities, and of communities to grow rapidly, depends in subtle ways on the underlying network structure. For example, the tendency of an individual to join a community is influenced not just by the number of friends he or she has within the community, but also crucially by how those friends are connected to one another. We use decision-tree techniques to identify the most significant structural determinants of these properties. We also develop a novel methodology for measuring movement of individuals between communities, and show how such movements are closely aligned with changes in the topics of interest within the communities.},

Ordinarily, the connection topology is assumed to be either completely regular or completely random. But many biological, technological and social networks lie somewhere between these two extremes. Here we explore simple models of networks that can be tuned through this middle ground: regular networks 'rewired' to introduce increasing amounts of disorder. We find that these systems can be highly clustered, like regular lattices, yet have small characteristic path lengths, like random graphs. We call them 'small-world' networks, by analogy with the small-world phenomenon (popularly known as six degrees of separation. The neural network of the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the power grid of the western United States, and the collaboration graph of film actors are shown to be small-world networks. Models of dynamical systems with small-world coupling display enhanced signal-propagation speed, computational power, and synchronizability. In particular, infectious diseases spread more easily in small-world networks than in regular lattices.},

@article{Kohavi2010,
abstract = {Tracking users' online clicks and form submits (e.g., searches) is critical for web analytics, controlled experiments, and business intelligence. Most sites use web beacons to track user actions, but waiting for the beacon to return on clicks and submits slows the next action (e.g., showing search results or the destination page). One possibility is to use a short timeout and common wisdom is that the more time given to the tracking mechanism (suspending the user action), the lower the data loss. Research from Amazon, Google, and Microsoft showed that small delays of a few hundreds of milliseconds have dramatic negative impact on revenue and user experience (Kohavi, et al., 2009 p. 173), yet we found that many websites allow long delays in order to collect click. For example, until March 2010, multiple Microsoft sites waited for click beacons to return with a 2-second timeout, introducing a delay of about 400msec on user clicks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first published empirical study of the subject under a controlled environment. While we confirm the common wisdom about the tradeoff in general, a surprising result is that the tradeoff does not exist for the most common browser family, Microsoft Internet Explorer (IE), where no delay suffices. This finding has significant implications for tracking users since no waits is required to prevent data loss for IE browsers and it could significantly improve revenue and user experience. The recommendations here have been implemented by the MSN US home page and Hotmail.},

abstract = {Background: Academic social tagging systems, such as Connotea and CiteULike, provide researchers with a means to organize personal collections of online references with keywords (tags) and to share these collections with others. One of the side-effects of the operation of these systems is the generation of large, publicly accessible metadata repositories describing the resources in the collections. In light of the well-known expansion of information in the life sciences and the need for metadata to enhance its value, these repositories present a potentially valuable new resource for application developers. Here we characterize the current contents of two scientifically relevant metadata repositories created through social tagging. This investigation helps to establish how such socially constructed metadata might be used as it stands currently and to suggest ways that new social tagging systems might be designed that would yield better aggregate products. Results: We assessed the metadata that users of CiteULike and Connotea associated with citations in PubMed with the following metrics: coverage of the document space, density of metadata (tags) per document, rates of inter-annotator agreement, and rates of agreement with MeSH indexing. CiteULike and Connotea were very similar on all of the measurements. In comparison to PubMed, document coverage and per-document metadata density were much lower for the social tagging systems. Inter-annotator agreement within the social tagging systems and the agreement between the aggregated social tagging metadata and MeSH indexing was low though the latter could be increased through voting. Conclusion: The most promising uses of metadata from current academic social tagging repositories will be those that find ways to utilize the novel relationships between users, tags, and documents exposed through these systems. For more traditional kinds of indexing-based applications (such as keyword-based search) to benefit substantially from socially generated metadata in the life sciences, more documents need to be tagged and more tags are needed for each document. These issues may be addressed both by finding ways to attract more users to current systems and by creating new user interfaces that encourage more collectively useful individual tagging behaviour.},

abstract = {Connotea 1 is a free online reference management and social bookmarking service for scientists created by Nature Publishing Group 2. While somewhat experimental in nature, Connotea already has a large and growing number of users, and is a real, fully functioning service 3. The label 'experimental' is not meant to imply that the service is any way ephemeral or esoteric, rather that the concept of social bookmarking itself and the application of that concept to reference management are both recent developments. Connotea is under active development, and we are still in the process of discovering how people will use it. In addition to Connotea being a free and public service, the core code is freely available under an open source license 4. Connotea was conceived from the outset as an online, social tool. Seeing the possibilities that del.icio.us 5 was opening up for its users in the area of general web linking, we realised that scholarly reference management was a similar problem space. Connotea was designed and developed late in 2004, and soft-launched at the end of December 2004.

This paper will start by giving an overview of Connotea, and will outline the key concepts and describe its main features.

However, the connectivity distribution does not uncover all the complexity of their topology. Here, we analyse the relation between the connectivity of a species and the average connectivity of its nearest neighbours in three of the most resolved community food webs. We compare the pattern arising with the one recently reported for protein networks and for a simple null model of a random network. Whereas two highly connected nodes are unlikely to be connected between each other in protein networks, the reverse happens in food webs. We discuss this difference in organization in relation to the robustness of biological networks to different types of perturbation.},

abstract = {The aim of this paper is to demonstrate that in models with large extra dimensions under special conditions one can extract information from the interior of 4D black holes. For this purpose we study an induced geometry on a test brane in the background of a higher dimensional static black string or a black brane. We show that at the intersection surface of the test brane and the bulk black string/brane the induced metric has an event horizon, so that the test brane contains a black hole. We call it a brane hole. When the test brane moves with a constant velocity V with respect to the bulk black object it also has a brane hole, but its gravitational radius r{\_}e is greater than the size of the bulk black string/brane r{\_}0 by the factor (1-V{\^{}}2){\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}. We show that bulk `photon' emitted in the region between r{\_}0 and r{\_}e can meet the test brane again at a point outside r{\_}e. From the point of view of observers on the test brane the events of emission and capture of the bulk `photon' are connected by a spacelike curve in the induced geometry. This shows an example in which extra dimensions can be used to extract information from the interior of a lower dimensional black object. Instead of the bulk black string/brane, one can also consider a bulk geometry without horizon. We show that nevertheless the induced geometry on the moving test brane can include a brane hole. In such a case the extra dimensions can be used to extract information from the complete region of the brane hole interior. We discuss thermodynamic properties of brane holes and interesting questions which arise when such an extra dimensional channel for the information mining exists.},

We introduce measures to characterise the blogosphere in terms of blogger and topic drift and we demonstrate how these measures can be used to construct a plausible explanation for blogger behaviour. We show that the blog domain is characterised by bloggers moving frequently from topic to topic and that blogger activity closely tracks events in the real world. We suggest that a blog recommendation strategy must be able to quickly detect and model topics and determine the potential relevance of each topic to each blogger.

Blog entries are generally organised using informally defined labels known as tags. Increasingly, tags are being proposed as a grassroots alternative to SemanticWeb standards. We demonstrate that tags by themselves are weak at partitioning blog data. We then show how tags may contribute useful, discriminating information. Using content-based clustering, we observe that frequently occurring tags in each cluster are usually good meta-labels for the cluster concept. We then introduce the Tr score, a score based on the proportion of high-frequency tags in a cluster, and demonstrate that it is strongly correlated with cluster strength. We demonstrate how the Tr score enables the detection and removal of weak clusters. As such, the Tr score can be used as an independent means of verifying topic integrity in a cluster-based recommender system.},

The group centrality measures will enable researchers to answer such questions as 'how central is the engineering department in the informal influence network of this company?' or 'among middle managers in a given organization, which are more central, the men or the women?' With these measures we can also solve the inverse problem: given the network of ties among organization members, how can we form a team that is maximally central? The measures are illustrated using two classic network data sets. We also formalize a measure of group centrality efficiency, which indicates the extent to which a group's centrality is principally due to a small subset of its members.},

Findings - Although simple, it performs slightly better than a much more elaborate system with which it has been compared. It effectively works by treating complex suffixes as compounds made up of simple suffixes, and removing the simple suffixes in a number of steps. In each step the removal of the suffix is made to depend upon the form of the remaining stem, which usually involves a measure of its syllable length.

We also propose a measure for the strength of the community structure found by our algorithms, which gives us an objective metric for choosing the number of communities into which a network should be divided. We demonstrate that our algorithms are highly effective at discovering community structure in both computer-generated and real-world network data, and show how they can be used to shed light on the sometimes dauntingly complex structure of networked systems.},

In evolutionary clustering, a good clustering result should fit the current data well, while simultaneously not deviate too dramatically from the recent history. To fulfill this dual purpose, a measure of temporal smoothness is integrated in the overall measure of clustering quality. In this paper, we propose two frameworks that incorporate temporal smoothness in evolutionary spectral clustering. For both frameworks, we start with intuitions gained from the well-known k -means clustering problem, and then propose and solve corresponding cost functions for the evolutionary spectral clustering problems. Our solutions to the evolutionary spectral clustering problems provide more stable and consistent clustering results that are less sensitive to short-term noises while at the same time are adaptive to long-term cluster drifts. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our methods provide the optimal solutions to the relaxed versions of the corresponding evolutionary k -means clustering problems. Performance experiments over a number of real and synthetic data sets illustrate our evolutionary spectral clustering methods provide more robust clustering results that are not sensitive to noise and can adapt to data drifts.},

@article{Delvenne2010,
abstract = {The complexity of biological, social, and engineering networks makes it desirable to find natural partitions into clusters (or communities) that can provide insight into the structure of the overall system and even act as simplified functional descriptions. Although methods for community detection abound, there is a lack of consensus on how to quantify and rank the quality of partitions. We introduce here the stability of a partition, a measure of its quality as a community structure based on the clustered autocovariance of a dynamic Markov process taking place on the network. Because the stability has an intrinsic dependence on time scales of the graph, it allows us to compare and rank partitions at each time and also to establish the time spans over which partitions are optimal. Hence the Markov time acts effectively as an intrinsic resolution parameter that establishes a hierarchy of increasingly coarser communities. Our dynamical definition provides a unifying framework for several standard partitioning measures: modularity and normalized cut size can be interpreted as one-step time measures, whereas Fiedler's spectral clustering emerges at long times. We apply our method to characterize the relevance of partitions over time for constructive and real networks, including hierarchical graphs and social networks, and use it to obtain reduced descriptions for atomic-level protein structures over different time scales.},

abstract = {We propose frameworks and algorithms for identifying communities in social networks that change over time. Communities are intuitively characterized as "unusually densely knit" subsets of a social network. This notion becomes more problematic if the social interactions change over time. Aggregating social networks over time can radically misrepresent the existing and changing community structure. Instead, we propose an optimization-based approach for modeling dynamic community structure. We prove that finding the most explanatory community structure is NP-hard and APX-hard, and propose algorithms based on dynamic programming, exhaustive search, maximum matching, and greedy heuristics. We demonstrate empirically that the heuristics trace developments of community structure accurately for several synthetic and real-world examples.},

There is a considerable variety of methods and, at the same time, a lack of methodological evaluation. This paper summarizes the present state of co-citation analysis and presents several methods of clustering references. The database used is a selection of 2,114 documents in the field of organization studies from 1986-2000. The evaluative study shows that the choice of methods has a strong impact on the results created. It also shows that the methods of cluster and factor analysis hitherto used have only a limited value in differentiating clearly between schools of scientific research - the 'invisible colleges'.},

abstract = {There's a "Frank {\&} Ernest" comic strip showing a chick breaking out of its shell, looking around, and saying, "Oh, wow! Paradigm shift!" Blame the late Thomas Kuhn. Few indeed are the philosophers or historians influential enough to make it into the funny papers, but Kuhn is one. The Structure of Scientific Revolutions is indeed a paradigmatic work in the history of science. Kuhn's use of terms such as "paradigm shift" and "normal science," his ideas of how scientists move from disdain through doubt to acceptance of a new theory, his stress on social and psychological factors in science-all have had profound effects on historians, scientists, philosophers, critics, writers, business gurus, and even the cartoonist in the street. Some scientists (such as Steven Weinberg and Ernst Mayr) are profoundly irritated by Kuhn, especially by the doubts he casts-or the way his work has been used to cast doubt-on the idea of scientific progress. Yet it has been said that the acceptance of plate tectonics in the 1960s, for instance, was sped by geologists' reluctance to be on the downside of a paradigm shift. Even Weinberg has said that "Structure has had a wider influence than any other book on the history of science." As one of Kuhn's obituaries noted, "We all live in a post-Kuhnian age." -Mary Ellen Curtin},

abstract = {The search for unifying properties of complex networks is popular, challenging, and important. For modeling approaches that focus on robustness and fragility as unifying concepts, the Internet is an especially attractive case study, mainly because its applications are ubiquitous and pervasive, and widely available expositions exist at every level of detail. Nevertheless, alternative approaches to modeling the Internet often make extremely different assumptions and derive opposite conclusions about fundamental properties of one and the same system. Fortunately, a detailed understanding of Internet technology combined with a unique ability to measure the network means that these differences can be understood thoroughly and resolved unambiguously. This article aims to make recent results of this process accessible beyond Internet specialists to the broader scientific community and to clarify several sources of basic methodological differences that are relevant beyond either the Internet or the two specific approaches focused on here (i.e., scale-free networks and highly optimized tolerance networks).},

abstract = {Effective work groups engage in external knowledge sharing-the exchange of information, know-how, and feedback with customers, organizational experts, and others outside of the group. This paper argues that the value of external knowledge sharing increases when work groups are more structurally diverse. A structurally diverse work group is one in which the members, by virtue of their different organizational affiliations, roles, or positions, can expose the group to unique sources of knowledge. It is hypothesized that if members of structurally diverse work groups engage in external knowledge sharing, their performance will improve because of this active exchange of knowledge through unique external sources. A field study of 182 work groups in a Fortune 500 telecommunications firm operationalizes structural diversity as member differences in geographic locations, functional assignments, reporting managers, and business units, as indicated by corporate database records. External knowledge sharing was measured with group member surveys and performance was assessed using senior executive ratings. Ordered logit analyses showed that external knowledge sharing was more strongly associated with performance when work groups were more structurally diverse. Implications for theory and practice around the integration of work groups and social networks are addressed.},

abstract = {Components, curriculum, and community-robots and robotics in undergraduate AI education.(artificial intelligence) The Article: Overviews a number of robot platforms and presents trade-offs in choosing among them. Highlight the variety of AI curricula supported by low-cost robotic platforms. Conclude with a summary of the engaging and active communities that support robotic competitions and exhibitions. 1. Platforms: A key advantage of the two most popular platforms, Lego Mindstorms (or RCX brick) and the Handy Board: the variety of ways in which students can program them. Other Kits: Palm Pilot robot kit (Reshko, Mason, and Nourbakhsh 2002; Avanzato 2004) Nintendo Game Boy Advance's Xport Robot Controller (XRC) and related XBC (LeGrand et al. 2005). Pontech's SV 203 (Bishop et al. 2004). They are less well established. One perceived disadvantage of robot kits: the resulting platforms can provide software support for only a low level of behavioral abstraction. How to mitigate: topics as computationally demanding and subtle as A search and Markov decision processes have run entirely on a Handy Board. Further, because it is easy to download information from each of these platforms to a PC, all of these systems can be used to collect data for off-board analysis In practice, a more important disadvantage of all of these platforms' flexibility: they are more difficult to support with simulation software, as neither the robot morphology nor its sensor suite is known a priori. In contrast to robot kits, preassembled platforms offer additional capabilities and convenience at a higher cost: K-Team's miniature robot, the Khepera; K-Team's newer and slightly larger robot, the Hemission Sony's robotic quadruped, the AIBO: existing resources may be easier to integrate 2. Simulations: Simulation is an attractive option for AI educators for many reasons: the speed of students' design-test-debug cycles, the repeatability of experiments, the availability of rich visualization tools that may not be available on board a physical platform the (simulated) access to expensive or unavailable platforms or sensors Two powerful, general-purpose simulators are the open-source projects Stage and Gazebo. One drawback to using simulation is the loss of the physical embodiment that attracts many students to learning AI with robots. Another potential problem is the loss of the unpredictability of real-world physical interaction. The ideal educational toolset comprises both a simulator and robot hardware with identical programming APIs. Simulators can expand the reach of a few (or no) hardware resources to a much larger class of students. 3. Sensing and Computation The sensor suite available is likely to have the greatest curricular-and financial-impact on an undergraduate's experience with AI robotics. Shaft encoders, which allow the measurement of position and velocity, and a ring of range sensors (sonar in the case of the Pioneers, IR for the Khepera and Hemisson) offer student access to spatial reasoning algorithms from basic wall following to topological mapping. 4. Onward The available resources for incorporating robots into AI education are considerable, yet they may only hint at the opportunities on the horizon. One emerging possibility is that some educational robots will blur away from the status quo of "complete systems" into peripheral form factors that use existing cameras, laptop computers, and networking capabilities. The impact, marketing power, and economies of scale in the toy and entertainment industry will continue to play important roles in creating inexpensive robotics resources. The software that supports AI robotics education will continue to mature: 1. Commercial third-party products such as the multiplatform Webots simulator and the RoboJDE development environment (Michel 2004) offer turnkey interfacing and development capabilities. 2. The research community: the Stage and Gazebo simulators demonstrate the benefits of developing a research-inspired codebase into a more general-purpose tool. 3. Enthusiasts of all stripes donate time and effort to make the materials they have developed available to the community. 5. AI Robotics Curricula Robot platforms can be introduced into AI education in a variety of ways, ranging from adding a single robot assignment to an AI course to designing a complete AI robotics course to adding AI material to an integrated robot engineering course. Robot kits such as the Lego RCX, Handy Board, or Xport use Lego building blocks and gears to provide an easy means for students to build mechanical structures. The use of such platforms must be weighed against the time students spend building and rebuilding. Alternatives approaches provide prebuilt platforms (for example, Bruder and Wedeward 2003) or plans for and examples of platforms to aid student construction. 6. Robot Contests: Robocup, AAAI 7.

abstract = {LEGO is a computer program for interactive typechecking in the Extended Calculus of Constructions and two of its subsystems. LEGO also supports the extension of these three systems with inductive types. These type systems can be viewed as logics, and as meta languages for expressing logics, and LEGO is intended to be used for interactively constructing proofs in mathematical theories presented in these logics. I have developed LEGO over six years, starting from an implementation of the Calculus of Constructions by G rard Huet. LEGO has been used for problems at the limits of our abilities to do formal mathematics. In this thesis I explain some aspects of the meta-theory of LEGO's type systems leading to a machine-checked proof that typechecking is decidable for all three type theories supported by LEGO, and to a verified algorithm for deciding their typing judgements, assuming only that they are normalizing. In order to do this, the theory of Pure Type Systems (PTS) is extended and formalized in LEGO. This extended example of a formally developed body of mathematics is described, both for its main theorems, and as a case study in formal mathematics. In many examples, I compare formal definitions and theorems with their informal counterparts, and with various alternative approaches, to study the meaning and use of mathematical language, and suggest clarifications in the informal usage. Having outlined a formal development far too large to be surveyed in detail by a human reader, I close with some thoughts on how the human mathematician's state of understanding and belief might be affected by possessing such a thing.},

A distinction must be made between the high latitudes (Washington route), on which an average dose equivalent rate of 1.49 mrem/h was recorded, and low latitudes (Rio de Janeiro and Caracas routes), on which the average dose equivalent rate was only 0.78 mrems/h.

Limited subjective tests conducted to examine the human detection and annoyance thresholds for building vibration and rattle caused by aircraft noise showed that both vibration and rattle were detected subjectively in several houses for some operations of both the Concorde and subsonic aircraft. Preliminary results indicate that the relationship between window vibration and aircraft noise is: (1) linear, with vibration levels being accurately predicted from OASPL levels measured near the window; (2) consistent from flyover to flyover for a given aircraft type under approach conditions; (3) no different for Concorde than for other conventional jet transports (in the case of window vibrations induced under approach power conditions); and (4) relatively high levels of window vibration measured during Concorde operations are due more to higher OASPL levels than to unique Concorde source characteristics.},

abstract = {The 1964 Labour government inherited a substantial balance-of-payments deficit. In an effort to deal with the attendant economic crisis, the government sought to cancel a number of costly, high-prestige projects, including the Franco-British supersonic airliner Concorde. When the possible ramifications of this were considered, however, it was discovered that the agreement covering the aircraft was not commercial but carried the full force of an international treaty. The clear implication of this was that a withdrawing party could be subject to heavy financial penalties. Cancellation, therefore, it was argued, was likely to cost even more than continuing with the project would. The question remains as to how such a remarkable situation had come about. This article analyses the negotiations between Britain and France concerning Concorde, particularly in the early 1960s, which eventually led to the signing of the treaty in 1962. It examines the political, technological, and economic imperatives which underpinned the negotiations and the relationships between the two governments and their respective aviation industries. It also considers the motives of both the British and French governments in the process, and concludes that in each case that the technological and political motives overrode economic considerations.},

abstract = {Infrasonic signals generated by daily supersonic Concorde flights between North America and Europe have been consistently recorded by an array of microbarographs in France. These signals are used to investigate the effects of atmospheric variability on long-range sound propagation. Statistical analysis of wave parameters shows seasonal and daily variations associated with changes in the wind structure of the atmosphere. The measurements are compared to the predictions obtained by tracing rays through realistic atmospheric models. Theoretical ray paths allow a consistent interpretation of the observed wave parameters. Variations in the reflection level, travel time, azimuth deviation and propagation range are explained by the source and propagation models. The angular deviation of a ray's azimuth direction, due to the seasonal and diurnal fluctuations of the transverse wind component, is found to be approximately 5 degrees from the initial launch direction. One application of the seasonal and diurnal variations of the observed phase parameters is the use of ground measurements to estimate fluctuations in the wind velocity at the reflection heights. The simulations point out that care must be taken when ascribing a phase velocity to a turning height. Ray path simulations which allow the correct computation of reflection heights are essential for accurate phase identifications.},

Refraction effects determined by temperature and wind conditions return the signal to the surface from both stratospheric (40 to 50 kilometers) and thermospheric (100 to 130 kilometers) levels. The frequency of the recorded signal is a function of the level of reflection; the frequency decreases from impulse stretching as the atmosphere becomes more rarified relative to the sound pressure. The horizontal trace velocity of the signal across the array of instruments is equal to the acoustic velocity at the reflection level. The sonic boom can thus be used to provide temperature-wind parameters at reflection levels estimated from the signal frequency. Daily observed signal variations have indicated significant variations in these parameters.},

It is suggested here, expanding on observations made by anthropologist Gregory Bateson some years ago, that Wallace's cybernetics-like view of the operation of natural selection-as a governor-like principle tending to keep species unvarying-can be expanded to a more complete evolutionary understanding by exploring in modern context Wallace's idea that "more recondite forces" are driving the process. Specifically, when the environment is regarded as a final cause (but not a deterministic force), individual adaptations may be viewed as entropy-relaying structures (acting in response to, and as a part of larger scale biogeochemical agenda), whereas negentropy is accumulated by nonrandomly directed organism- and population-level forms of ecological engagement. Thus, range change in particular is viewed as a process that is both driven and nonrandom, and ultimately connected to the derivation of more and more organized individual, population, and community structures.

abstract = {This paper examines how the 19th-century British naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace used biogeographical mapping practices to draw a boundary line between Malay and Papuan groups in the colonial East Indies in the 1850s. Instead of looking for a continuous gradient of variation between Malays and Papuans, Wallace chose to look for a sharp discontinuity between them. While Wallace's "human biogeography" paralleled his similar project to map plant and animal distributions in the same region, he invoked distinctive "mental and moral" features as more decisive than physical ones. By following Wallace in the field, we can see his field mapping practices in action - how he conquered the problem of local particularity in the case of human variation. His experiences on the periphery of expanding European empires, far from metropolitan centers, shaped Wallace's observations in the field. Taking his cues from colonial racial categories and his experiences collaborating with local people in the field, Wallace constructed the boundary line between the Malay and Papuan races during several years of work in the field criss-crossing the archipelago as a scientific collector. This effort to map a boundary line in the field was a bold example of using the practices of survey science to raise the status of field work by combining fact gathering with higher-level generalizing, although the response back in the metropole was less than enthusiastic. Upon his return to Britain in the 1860s, Wallace found that appreciation for observational facts he had gathered in the field was not accompanied by agreement with his theoretical interpretations and methods for doing human biogeography.},

abstract = {During 2009, while we were celebrating Charles Darwin and his The origin of species, sadly, little was said about the critical contribution of Alfred Russel Wallace (1823-1913) to the development of the theory of evolution. Like Darwin, he was a truly remarkable nineteenth century intellect and polymath and, according to a recent book by Roy Davies (The Darwin conspiracy: origins of a scientific crime), he has a stronger claim to the Theory of Evolution by Natural Selection than has Darwin. Here we present a critical comparison between the contributions of the two scientists. Sometimes referred to as 'The other beetle-hunter' and largely neglected for many decades, Wallace had a far greater experience of collecting and investigating animals and plants from their native habitats than had Darwin. He was furthermore much more than a pioneer biogeographer and evolutionary theorist, and also made contributions to anthropology, ethnography, geology, land reform and social issues. However, being a more modest, self-deprecating man than Darwin, and lacking the latter's establishment connections, Wallace's contribution to the theory of evolution was not given the recognition it deserved and he was undoubtedly shabbily treated at the time. It is time that Wallace's relationship with Darwin is reconsidered in preparation for 2013, the centenary of Wallace's death, and he should be recognized as at least an equal in the Wallace-Darwin theory of evolution.},

@article{Smith2005,
abstract = {The naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace (1823-1913) has for many years been standing in the shadow of his more famed co-discoverer of the principle of natural selection, Charles Darwin. Despite outward similarities between the two men's formulation of the principle, Wallace had fit his appreciation of natural selection into views on evolution that were quite different from Darwin's. A closer examination of what Wallace had in mind suggests a model of process in which natural selection per se acts as the negative feedback mechanism (actually, a 'state-space') in the relation between population and environment, and environmental engagement as made possible by the resulting selection of traits acts as the positive feedback part of the cycle. Thus, it may be better to contextualize adaptive structures as entropy-relaying biogeochemical facilitators that only 'generate a potential for evolution' than to portray them as the end results of evolution. This systems point of view better lends itself to appreciations of the biogeographical context of evolution than does the tree-thinking of a more conventional style of speciation-focused Darwinism, which sometimes confuses process with result},

abstract = {Alfred Russel Wallace, eminent naturalist and codiscoverer of the principle of natural selection, was a major participant in the antivaccination campaigns in late 19th-century England. Wallace combined social reformism and quantitative arguments to undermine the claims of provaccinationists and had a major impact on the debate. A brief account of Wallace's background, his role in the campaign, and a summary of his quantitative arguments leads to the conclusion that it is unwarranted to portray Victorian antivaccination campaigners in general as irrational and antiscience. Public health policy can benefit from history, but the proper context of the evidence used should always be kept in mind.},

This question is becoming crucial as we try to explain the emergent scale-free topology of the World Wide Web and use link analysis to identify important information resources. Existing models of growing information networks have focused on the structure of links but neglected the content of nodes. Here I show that the current models fail to reproduce a critical characteristic of information networks, namely the distribution of textual similarity among linked documents. I propose a more realistic model that generates links by using both popularity and content. This model yields remarkably accurate predictions of both degree and similarity distributions in networks of web pages and scientific literature.},

Written in short, carefully numbered paragraphs of extreme brilliance, it captured the imagination of a generation of philosophers. For Wittgenstein, logic was something we use to conquer a reality which is in itself both elusive and unobtainable. He famously summarized the book in the following words: 'What can be said at all can be said clearly; and what we cannot talk about we must pass over in silence.' David Pears and Brian McGuinness received the highest praise for their meticulous translation. The work is prefaced by Bertrand Russell's original introduction to the first English edition.},

Black-hole encounters, within bound galactic clusters in that previous aeon, would have the observable effect, in our CMB sky, of families of concentric circles over which the temperature variance is anomalously low, the centre of each such family representing the point of 'I' at which the cluster converges. These centres appear as fairly randomly distributed fixed points in our CMB sky. The analysis of Wilkinson Microwave Background Probe's (WMAP) cosmic microwave background 7-year maps does indeed reveal such concentric circles, of up to 6{\{}$\backslash$sigma{\}} significance. This is confirmed when the same analysis is applied to BOOMERanG98 data, eliminating the possibility of an instrumental cause for the effects. These observational predictions of CCC would not be easily explained within standard inflationary cosmology.},

abstract = {In recent years, tagging systems have become increasingly popular. These systems enable users to add keywords (i.e., "tags") to Internet resources (e.g., web pages, images, videos) without relying on a controlled vocabulary. Tagging systems have the potential to improve search, spam detection, reputation systems, and personal organization while introducing new modalities of social communication and opportunities for data mining. This potential is largely due to the social structure that underlies many of the current systems.Despite the rapid expansion of applications that support tagging of resources, tagging systems are still not well studied or understood. In this paper, we provide a short description of the academic related work to date. We offer a model of tagging systems, specifically in the context of web-based systems, to help us illustrate the possible benefits of these tools. Since many such systems already exist, we provide a taxonomy of tagging systems to help inform their analysis and design, and thus enable researchers to frame and compare evidence for the sustainability of such systems. We also provide a simple taxonomy of incentives and contribution models to inform potential evaluative frameworks. While this work does not present comprehensive empirical results, we present a preliminary study of the photo-sharing and tagging system Flickr to demonstrate our model and explore some of the issues in one sample system. This analysis helps us outline and motivate possible future directions of research in tagging systems.},

abstract = {Collaborative tagging describes the process by which many users add metadata in the form of keywords to shared content. Recently, collaborative tagging has grown in popularity on the web, on sites that allow users to tag bookmarks, photographs and other content. In this paper we analyze the structure of collaborative tagging systems as well as their dynamical aspects. Specifically, we discovered regularities in user activity, tag frequencies, kinds of tags used, bursts of popularity in bookmarking and a remarkable stability in the relative proportions of tags within a given url. We also present a dynamical model of collaborative tagging that predicts these stable patterns and relates them to imitation and shared knowledge.},

abstract = {Objective: We critically evaluated the etiologic role of inorganic arsenic in human prostate cancer. Data sources: We assessed data from relevant epidemiologic studies concerning environmental inorganic arsenic exposure. Whole animal studies were evaluated as were in vitro model systems of inorganic arsenic carcinogenesis in the prostate. Data synthesis: Multiple studies in humans reveal an association between environmental inorganic arsenic exposure and prostate cancer mortality or incidence. Many of these human studies provide clear evidence of a doseresponse relationship. Relevant whole animal models showing a relationship between inorganic arsenic and prostate cancer are not available. However, cellular model systems indicate arsenic can induce malignant transformation of human prostate epithelial cells in vitro. Arsenic also appears to impact prostate cancer cell progression by precipitating events leading to androgen independence in vitro. Conclusion: Available evidence in human populations and human cells in vitro indicates that the prostate is a target for inorganic arsenic carcinogenesis. A role for this common environmental contaminant in human prostate cancer initiation and/or progression would be very important.},

abstract = {We determined global transcriptional responses of Escherichia coli K-12 to sulfur (S)- or nitrogen (N)-limited growth in adapted batch cultures and cultures subjected to nutrient shifts. Using two limitations helped to distinguish between nutrient-specific changes in mRNA levels and common changes related to the growth rate. Both homeostatic and slow growth responses were amplified upon shifts. This made detection of these responses more reliable and increased the number of genes that were differentially expressed. We analyzed microarray data in several ways: by determining expression changes after use of a statistical normalization algorithm, by hierarchical and k-means clustering, and by visual inspection of aligned genome images. Using these tools, we confirmed known homeostatic responses to global S limitation, which are controlled by the activators CysB and Cbl, and found that S limitation propagated into methionine metabolism, synthesis of FeS clusters, and oxidative stress. In addition, we identified several open reading frames likely to respond specifically to S availability. As predicted from the fact that the ddp operon is activated by NtrC, synthesis of cross-links between diaminopimelate residues in the murein layer was increased under N-limiting conditions, as was the proportion of tripeptides. Both of these effects may allow increased scavenging of N from the dipeptide D-alanine-D-alanine, the substrate of the Ddp system.},

@article{Vazquez-Semadeni2010a,
abstract = {I review recent numerical and analytical work on the feedback from both low- and high-mass cluster stars into their gasoeus environment. The main conclusions are that i) outflow driving appears capable of maintaing the turbulence in parsec-sized clumps and retarding their collapse from the free-fall rate, although there exist regions within molecular clouds, and even some examples of whole clouds, which are not actively forming stars, yet are just as turbulent, so that a more universal turbulence-driving mechanism is needed; ii) outflow-driven turbulence exhibits specific spectral features that can be tested observationally; iii) feedback plays an important role in reducing the star formation rate; iv) nevertheless, numerical simulations suggest that feedback cannot completely prevent a net contracting motion of clouds and clumps. Therefore, an appealing source for driving the turbulence everywhere in GMCs is the accretion from the environment, at all scales. In this case, feedback's most important role may be to prevent a fraction of the gas nearest to newly formed stars from actually reaching them, thus reducing the star formation efficiency.},

We have made tremendous advances first in the development of the techniques to observe these anisotropies and in observing and interpreting them to extract their contained cosmological information.

@article{Guth1981,
abstract = {The standard model of hot big-bang cosmology requires initial conditions which are problematic in two ways: (1) The early universe is assumed to be highly homogeneous, in spite of the fact that separated regions were causally disconnected (horizon problem); and (2) the initial value of the Hubble constant must be fine tuned to extraordinary accuracy to produce a universe as flat (i.e., near critical mass density) as the one we see today (flatness problem). These problems would disappear if, in its early history, the universe supercooled to temperatures 28 or more orders of magnitude below the critical temperature for some phase transition. A huge expansion factor would then result from a period of exponential growth, and the entropy of the universe would be multiplied by a huge factor when the latent heat is released. Such a scenario is completely natural in the context of grand unified models of elementary-particle interactions. In such models, the supercooling is also relevant to the problem of monopole suppression. Unfortunately, the scenario seems to lead to some unacceptable consequences, so modifications must be sought. 1981 The American Physical Society.},

Microinjection of carbachol into the rostral and dorsolateral part of the PoO rapidly inhibited reflex micturition and external urethral sphincter (EUS) activity. After confirming the inhibition of reflex micturition and EUS activity by microinjection of carbachol into the PoO, intravenous injection of atropine sulfate or its microinjection into the PoO recovered both reflex micturition and EUS activity. Microinjection of carbachol into the PMC evoked micturition and then inhibited reflex micturition, but intravenous injection of atropine or its microinjection into the PoO recovered reflex micturition. After confi rming the inhibition of reflex micturition and EUS activity by microinjection of carbachol into the PoO, electrical stimulation of the PUSC enhanced EUS activity, but electrical stimulation of the PMC failed to evoke micturition. However, electrical stimulation of the PMC evoked micturition after microinjection of atropine into the PoO. These results suggest that the PoO strongly inhibits the PMC and less strongly inhibits the PUSC. Therefore, the PoO seems to be the pontine micturition inhibitory area.},

I concentrate on general techniques which are common in cosmology, or techniques which have been developed in a cosmological context. In fact they have very general applicability, for problems which are firmly model-based, and thus lend themselves to a Bayesian treatment. We consider the general problem of estimating parameters from data, and consider how one can use Fisher matrices to analyse survey designs before any data are taken, to see whether the survey will actually do what is required. We outline numerical methods for estimating parameters from data, including Monte Carlo Markov Chains and the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo method. We also look at Model Selection, which covers various scenarios such as whether an extra parameter is preferred by the data, or answering wider questions such as which theoretical framework is favoured, using General Relativity and braneworld gravity as an example.},

abstract = {We study the distributions of citations received by a single publication within several disciplines, spanning broad areas of science. We show that the probability that an article is cited c times has large variations between different disciplines, but all distributions are rescaled on a universal curve when the relative indicator c(f) = c/c(0) is considered, where c(0) is the average number of citations per article for the discipline. In addition we show that the same universal behavior occurs when citation distributions of articles published in the same field, but in different years, are compared. These findings provide a strong validation of c(f) as an unbiased indicator for citation performance across disciplines and years. Based on this indicator, we introduce a generalization of the h index suitable for comparing scientists working in different fields.},

abstract = {Recently, the abundance of digital data is enabling the implementation of graph-based ranking algorithms that provide system level analysis for ranking publications and authors. Here, we take advantage of the entire Physical Review publication archive (1893-2006) to construct authors' networks where weighted edges, as measured from opportunely normalized citation counts, define a proxy for the mechanism of scientific credit transfer. On this network, we define a ranking method based on a diffusion algorithm that mimics the spreading of scientific credits on the network. We compare the results obtained with our algorithm with those obtained by local measures such as the citation count and provide a statistical analysis of the assignment of major career awards in the area of physics. A website where the algorithm is made available to perform customized rank analysis can be found at the address http://www.physauthorsrank.org.},

The output of this algorithm, which we call CiteRank, is interpreted as approximate traffic to individual publications in a simple model of how researchers find new information. We develop an analytical understanding of traffic flow in terms of an RPA-like model and optimize parameters of our algorithm to achieve the best performance. The results are compared for two rather different citation networks: all American Physical Society publications and the set of high-energy physics theory (hep-th) preprints. Despite major differences between these two networks, we find that their optimal parameters for the CiteRank algorithm are remarkably similar.},

@article{Cattuto2010b,
abstract = {Background
Digital networks, mobile devices, and the possibility of mining the ever-increasing amount of digital traces that we leave behind in our daily activities are changing the way we can approach the study of human and social interactions. Large-scale datasets, however, are mostly available for collective and statistical behaviors, at coarse granularities, while high-resolution data on person-to-person interactions are generally limited to relatively small groups of individuals. Here we present a scalable experimental framework for gathering real-time data resolving face-to-face social interactions with tunable spatial and temporal granularities.

Methods and Findings
We use active Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) devices that assess mutual proximity in a distributed fashion by exchanging low-power radio packets. We analyze the dynamics of person-to-person interaction networks obtained in three high-resolution experiments carried out at different orders of magnitude in community size. The data sets exhibit common statistical properties and lack of a characteristic time scale from 20 seconds to several hours. The association between the number of connections and their duration shows an interesting super-linear behavior, which indicates the possibility of defining super-connectors both in the number and intensity of connections.

Conclusions
Taking advantage of scalability and resolution, this experimental framework allows the monitoring of social interactions, uncovering similarities in the way individuals interact in different contexts, and identifying patterns of super-connector behavior in the community. These results could impact our understanding of all phenomena driven by face-to-face interactions, such as the spreading of transmissible infectious diseases and information.},

We propose an unsupervised generative switching model that simultaneously captures the system dynamics as the outcome of both (i) the influence between individuals (each modeled as an HMM), and (ii) the dynamics of the influence itself. We describe here a variational Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. In our experiments, we illustrate applications of detecting structural change, predicting turn taking by analyzing a real group discussion behavior dataset and understanding flu influence patterns between US states. Results demonstrate that our approach is a strong alternative for modeling complex interacting social systems.},

We study the case where this assumption is weakened, so that measurement settings and local variables can be at least partially correlated. We demonstrate a connection between this type of model and classical communication models, and a connection with models that exploit the detection efficiency loophole. We show that even if Bob enjoys full free will, if Alice lacks a single bit of free will - in the sense that the mutual information between local variables and her measurement setting is one bit - then all correlations obtained from projective measurements on a singlet can be reproduced by local means.},

We report the development of Robot Scientist "Adam," which advances the automation of both. Adam has autonomously generated functional genomics hypotheses about the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and experimentally tested these hypotheses by using laboratory automation. We have confirmed Adam's conclusions through manual experiments. To describe Adam's research, we have developed an ontology and logical language. The resulting formalization involves over 10,000 different research units in a nested treelike structure, 10 levels deep, that relates the 6.6 million biomass measurements to their logical description. This formalization describes how a machine contributed to scientific knowledge.},

abstract = {Digital media and communication networks have become an important cyberinfrastructure to enable new levels of interactions in organizations and communities. A complicated knowledge network of individuals, documents, data, concepts, and their interconnections forms a virtual knowledge repository. To be more effective in using these resources, knowledge discovery tools are crucial for an organization and individual users to identify the right expertise or knowledge resources from this large "multidimensional network." Cyberinfrastructure Knowledge Networks on the Web (CI-KNOW) is a suite of Web-based tools that facilitates discovery of resources within communities. CI-KNOW implements a network recommendation system that incorporates social motivations for why we create, maintain, and dissolve our knowledge network ties. The network data is captured by automated harvesting of digital resources using Web crawlers, text miners, tagging tools that automatically generate community-oriented metadata, and scientometric data such as co-authorship and citations. Based on this knowledge network, the CI-KNOW recommender system produces personalized search results through two steps: identify matching entities according to their metadata and network statistics and select the best fits according to requester's perspectives and connections in social networks. Integrated with community Web portals, CI-KNOW navigation and auditing portlets provide analysis and visualization tools for community members and serves as a research testbed to examine social theories on individuals' motivations for seeking expertise from specific resources (people, documents, datasets, and etc.). As a proof-of-concept, this paper demonstrates how CI-KNOW, integrated with the NCI-supported Tobacco Informatics Grid (TobIG), facilitates knowledge sharing in the tobacco control research community.},

@article{Uzzi2005,
abstract = {Many sensational ideas have faded away into obscurity because they failed to reach the right people. A strong personal network, however, can launch a burgeoning plan into the limelight by delivering private information, access to diverse skill sets, and power. Most executives know that they need to learn about the best ideas and that, in turn, their best ideas must be heard by the rest of the world. But strong personal networks don't just happen around a watercooler or at reunions with old college friends. As Brian Uzzi and Shannon Dunlap explain, networks have to be carefully constructed through relatively high-stakes activities that bring you into contact with a diverse group of people. Most personal networks are highly clustered-that is, your friends are likely to be friends with one another as well. And, if you made those friends by introducing yourself to them, the chances are high that their experiences and perspectives echo your own. Because ideas generated within this type of network circulate among the same people with shared views, though, a potential winner can wither away and die if no one in the group has what it takes to bring that idea to fruition. But what if someone within that cluster knows someone else who belongs to a whole different group? That connection, formed by an information broker, can expose your idea to a new world, filled with fresh opportunities for success. Diversity makes the difference. Uzzi and Dunlap show you how to assess what kind of network you currently have, helping you to identify your super-connectors and demonstrating how you act as an information broker for others. They then explain how to diversify your contacts through shared activities and how to manage your new, more potent, network.},

abstract = {People exert large amounts of problem-solving effort playing computer games. Simple image- and text-recognition tasks have been successfully ‘crowd-sourced' through games1, 2, 3, but it is not clear if more complex scientific problems can be solved with human-directed computing. Protein structure prediction is one such problem: locating the biologically relevant native conformation of a protein is a formidable computational challenge given the very large size of the search space. Here we describe Foldit, a multiplayer online game that engages non-scientists in solving hard prediction problems. Foldit players interact with protein structures using direct manipulation tools and user-friendly versions of algorithms from the Rosetta structure prediction methodology4, while they compete and collaborate to optimize the computed energy. We show that top-ranked Foldit players excel at solving challenging structure refinement problems in which substantial backbone rearrangements are necessary to achieve the burial of hydrophobic residues. Players working collaboratively develop a rich assortment of new strategies and algorithms; unlike computational approaches, they explore not only the conformational space but also the space of possible search strategies. The integration of human visual problem-solving and strategy development capabilities with traditional computational algorithms through interactive multiplayer games is a powerful new approach to solving computationally-limited scientific problems.},

abstract = {Nanomaterials have garnered increasing interest recently as potential therapeutic drug-delivery vehicles. Among the existing nanomaterials are the pure carbon-based particles, such as fullerenes and nanotubes, various organic dendrimers, liposomes and other polymeric compounds. These vehicles have been decorated with a wide spectrum of target-reactive ligands, such as antibodies and peptides, which interact with cell-surface tumor antigens or vascular epitopes. Once targeted, these new nanomaterials can then deliver radioisotopes or isotope generators to the cancer cells. Here, we will review some of the more common nanomaterials under investigation and their current and future applications as drug-delivery scaffolds with particular emphasis on targeted cancer radiotherapy.},

abstract = {The power of nanotechnology is realized in its application in numerous areas. One such area is undoubtedly the use of metallic nanoparticles as a direct write application. An effort in this area has resulted in a conductive ink whose conductivity approaches 60-70{\%} that of the bulk copper. Such an ink has been developed by reducing silver, gold, and copper nano-sized powders by a wet method and followed by a heat treatment at less than 400 degrees C. The conductivity of the resulting ink product was found to be very much affected by how various sizes of metal powders are packed when particles were dried and packed on various substrates. The effect of packing and various kinds of metal powders on the eventual conductivity of the final product of the ink has been described and discussed in this paper.},

Scientists have always read strategically, working with many articles simultaneously to search, filter, scan, link, annotate, and analyze fragments of content. An observed recent increase in strategic reading in the online environment will soon be further intensified by two current trends: (i) the widespread use of digital indexing, retrieval, and navigation resources and (ii) the emergence within many scientific disciplines of interoperable ontologies. Accelerated and enhanced by reading tools that take advantage of ontologies, reading practices will become even more rapid and indirect, transforming the ways in which scientists engage the literature and shaping the evolution of scientific publishing.},

abstract = {Search engines have become key media for our scientific, economic, and social activities by enabling people to access information on the web despite its size and complexity. On the down side, search engines bias the traffic of users according to their page ranking strategies, and it has been argued that they create a vicious cycle that amplifies the dominance of established and already popular sites. This bias could lead to a dangerous monopoly of information. We show that, contrary to intuition, empirical data do not support this conclusion; popular sites receive far less traffic than predicted. We discuss a model that accurately predicts traffic data patterns by taking into consideration the topical interests of users and their searching behavior in addition to the way search engines rank pages. The heterogeneity of user interests explains the observed mitigation of search engines' popularity bias.},

abstract = {In the late 1990s, observations of Type Ia supernovae led to the astounding discovery that the universe is expanding at an accelerating rate. The explanation of this anomalous acceleration has been one of the great problems in physics since that discovery. In this article we propose cosmological models that can explain the cosmic acceleration without introducing a cosmological constant into the standard Einstein field equation, negating the necessity for the existence of dark energy. There are four distinguishing features of these models: 1) the speed of light and the gravitational "constant" are not constant, but vary with the evolution of the universe, 2) time has no beginning and no end, 3) the spatial section of the universe is a 3-sphere, and 4) the universe experiences phases of both acceleration and deceleration. One of these models is selected and tested against current cosmological observations of Type Ia supernovae, and is found to fit the redshift-luminosity distance data quite well.},

@article{Jessup2009,
abstract = {In November-December 2007 a widespread seabird mortality event occurred in Monterey Bay, California, USA, coincident with a massive red tide caused by the dinoflagellate Akashiwo sanguinea. Affected birds had a slimy yellow-green material on their feathers, which were saturated with water, and they were severely hypothermic. We determined that foam containing surfactant-like proteins, derived from organic matter of the red tide, coated their feathers and neutralized natural water repellency and insulation. No evidence of exposure to petroleum or other oils or biotoxins were found. This is the first documented case of its kind, but previous similar events may have gone undetected. The frequency and amplitude of red tides have increased in Monterey Bay since 2004, suggesting that impacts on wintering marine birds may continue or increase.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recent reports on the state of the global environment provide evidence that humankind is inflicting great damage to the very ecosystems that support human livelihoods. The reports further predict that ecosystems will take centuries to recover from damages if they recover at all. Accordingly, there is despair that we are passing on a legacy of irreparable damage to future generations which is entirely inconsistent with principles of sustainability. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We tested the prediction of irreparable harm using a synthesis of recovery times compiled from 240 independent studies reported in the scientific literature. We provide startling evidence that most ecosystems globally can, given human will, recover from very major perturbations on timescales of decades to half-centuries. SIGNIFICANCE/CONCLUSIONS: Accordingly, we find much hope that humankind can transition to more sustainable use of ecosystems.},

@article{Eysenbach2005,
abstract = {In an ongoing effort of this Journal to develop and further the theories, models, and best practices around eHealth research, this paper argues for the need for a "science of attrition", that is, a need to develop models for discontinuation of eHealth applications and the related phenomenon of participants dropping out of eHealth trials. What I call "law of attrition" here is the observation that in any eHealth trial a substantial proportion of users drop out before completion or stop using the application. This feature of eHealth trials is a distinct characteristic compared to, for example, drug trials. The traditional clinical trial and evidence-based medicine paradigm stipulates that high dropout rates make trials less believable. Consequently eHealth researchers tend to gloss over high dropout rates, or not to publish their study results at all, as they see their studies as failures. However, for many eHealth trials, in particular those conducted on the Internet and in particular with self-help applications, high dropout rates may be a natural and typical feature. Usage metrics and determinants of attrition should be highlighted, measured, analyzed, and discussed. This also includes analyzing and reporting the characteristics of the subpopulation for which the application eventually "works", ie, those who stay in the trial and use it. For the question of what works and what does not, such attrition measures are as important to report as pure efficacy measures from intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses. In cases of high dropout rates efficacy measures underestimate the impact of an application on a population which continues to use it. Methods of analyzing attrition curves can be drawn from survival analysis methods, eg, the Kaplan-Meier analysis and proportional hazards regression analysis (Cox model). Measures to be reported include the relative risk of dropping out or of stopping the use of an application, as well as a "usage half-life", and prediction models reporting demographic usage discontinuation in a population. Differential dropout or usage rates between two interventions could be a standard metric for the "usability efficacy" of a system. A "run-in and withdrawal" trial design is suggested as a methodological innovation for Internet-based trials with a high number of initial dropouts/nonusers and a stable group of hardcore users.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The use of Web (i.e. Internet)-derived health information within the health care encounter is rapidly increasing. In this article, an extensive review of the complex effects and sometimes contradictory roles of the Web in regard to health care delivery and the physician-patient relationship is presented. METHODS: A review of relevant literature was conducted, with key points integrated into a physician guide for effective interaction with Web-activated patients. RESULTS: An emerging consumerist model with "triangulation" of patient-Web-physician can be expected to significantly impact dynamics of the physician-patient relationship. Potential advantages of Web-acquired information include helping patients make informed health care choices (with potential to decrease health care disparities), shared decision-making with a collaborative, teamwork approach, more efficient use of clinical time, augmenting of physician-provided information, online support groups, and/or access to patients' own health information. Alternatively, factors such as misinformation due to highly variable quality of Web information, possible exacerbation of socioeconomic health disparities, and shifting of conventional notions of the physician-patient relationship ("traditional" medical authority) present their own set of challenges for the health care provider. CONCLUSION: A tangible guide to the integration of patients' use of the Web within a medical practice is thus offered with recommended communication skills. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: The "net-friendly" clinician can be effective by engendering a genuine partnership with patients, thus contributing to quality health care.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To test whether individuals experience cognitive biases whilst searching using information retrieval systems. Biases investigated are anchoring, order, exposure and reinforcement. DESIGN: A retrospective analysis and a prospective experiment were conducted to investigate whether cognitive biases affect the way that documentary evidence is interpreted while searching online. The retrospective analysis was conducted on the search and decision behaviors of 75 clinicians (44 doctors, 31 nurses), answering questions for 8 clinical scenarios within 80 minutes in a controlled setting. The prospective study was conducted on 227 undergraduate students, who used the same search engine to answer two of six randomly assigned consumer health questions. MEASUREMENTS: Frequencies of correct answers pre- and post- search, and confidence in answers were collected. The impact of reading a document on the final decision was measured by the population likelihood ratio (LR) of the frequency of reading the document and the frequency of obtaining a correct answer. Documents with a LR {\textgreater} 1 were most likely to be associated with a correct answer, and those with a LR {\textless} 1 were most likely to be associated with an incorrect answer to a question. Agreement between a subject and the evidence they read was estimated by a concurrence rate, which measured the frequency that subjects' answers agreed with the likelihood ratios of a group of documents, normalized for document order, time exposure or reinforcement through repeated access. Serial position curves were plotted for the relationship between subjects' pre-search confidence, document order, the number of times and length of time a document was accessed, and concurrence with post-search answers. Chi-square analyses tested for the presence of biases, and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test checked for equality of distribution of evidence in the comparison populations. RESULTS: A person's prior belief (anchoring) has a significant impact on their post-search answer (retrospective: P {\textless} 0.001; prospective: P {\textless} 0.001). Documents accessed at different positions in a search session (order effect [retrospective: P = 0.76; prospective: P = 0.026]), and documents processed for different lengths of time (exposure effect [retrospective: P = 0.27; prospective: P = 0.0081]) also influenced decision post-search more than expected in the prospective experiment but not in the retrospective analysis. Reinforcement through repeated exposure to a document did not yield statistical differences in decision outcome post-search (retrospective: P = 0.31; prospective: P = 0.81). CONCLUSION: People may experience anchoring, exposure and order biases while searching for information, and these biases may influence the quality of decision making during and after the use of information retrieval systems.},

@article{Frost2008,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: This project investigates the ways in which patients respond to the shared use of what is often considered private information: personal health data. There is a growing demand for patient access to personal health records. The predominant model for this record is a repository of all clinically relevant health information kept securely and viewed privately by patients and their health care providers. While this type of record does seem to have beneficial effects for the patient-physician relationship, the complexity and novelty of these data coupled with the lack of research in this area means the utility of personal health information for the primary stakeholders-the patients-is not well documented or understood. OBJECTIVE: PatientsLikeMe is an online community built to support information exchange between patients. The site provides customized disease-specific outcome and visualization tools to help patients understand and share information about their condition. We begin this paper by describing the components and design of the online community. We then identify and analyze how users of this platform reference personal health information within patient-to-patient dialogues. METHODS: Patients diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) post data on their current treatments, symptoms, and outcomes. These data are displayed graphically within personal health profiles and are reflected in composite community-level symptom and treatment reports. Users review and discuss these data within the Forum, private messaging, and comments posted on each other's profiles. We analyzed member communications that referenced individual-level personal health data to determine how patient peers use personal health information within patient-to-patient exchanges. RESULTS: Qualitative analysis of a sample of 123 comments (about 2{\%} of the total) posted within the community revealed a variety of commenting and questioning behaviors by patient members. Members referenced data to locate others with particular experiences to answer specific health-related questions, to proffer personally acquired disease-management knowledge to those most likely to benefit from it, and to foster and solidify relationships based on shared concerns. CONCLUSIONS: Few studies examine the use of personal health information by patients themselves. This project suggests how patients who choose to explicitly share health data within a community may benefit from the process, helping them engage in dialogues that may inform disease self-management. We recommend that future designs make each patient's health information as clear as possible, automate matching of people with similar conditions and using similar treatments, and integrate data into online platforms for health conversations.},

@book{Kuhn1962,
abstract = {Ouvrage majeur de la nouvelle philosophie des sciences. Kuhn y expose son id e fondamentale: l'histoire de la science peut tre divis e en p riodes de sciences normales, pendant lesquelles un paradigme est accept par un groupe scientifiques qui essaie de r soudre les nigmes soulev es, et en p riodes de r volutions scientifiques, pendant lesquelles un paradigme dont des exp riences ont soulev les anomalies est remis en cause puis d tr n par un paradigme adversaire.Average Customer Rating: 4.0Rating: 2Kuhn's rights and wrongsKuhn, like Popper before him, noticed a very important truth but failed to see it clearly and mixed it with a terribly harmful mistake. Before explaining that truth and that mistake, I would like to clarify the meaning of the term paradigm which Kuhn used in presenting his ideas. As he later acknowledged, he gave two different definitions of this term: (a) a paradigm is a successful model that is imitated to acquire new scientific knowledge, and (b) a paradigm is made up of all accepted knowledge and the methods and means of acquiring new knowledge. These two definitions become one if we assume that the concept "model" covers all accepted knowledge and the methods and means of acquiring new knowledge. The use of terms that are not clearly defined facilitates making mistakes. The truth noticed by Kuhn is that no knowledge can be proven to be valid in a general way using deductive logic, experimentation and/or observation, or any other method. The reason for this is that all empirical testing of knowledge can be done only on a limited number of singular phenomena. This also means that no general knowledge can be produced through deductive logic, experimentation and/or observation, or any other method. General knowledge is produced by "generalizing through induction," in Newton's words, what is learned from a limited number of singular phenomena through deduction from the related empirical data. But Kuhn ignores where induction is used in scientific work, as he admits when he says, "somewhere in this maze lies the problem of induction." Those who read Kuhn can profit from learning that general knowledge cannot be produced or tested using deductive logic, experimentation and/or observation, or any other method. The mistake made by Kuhn is that he presents the truth that he noticed, i.e., the nonexistence of a method of general validation of knowledge, as if it were related only to theoretical knowledge, or theories. He often uses the terms theory and paradigm interchangeably, for example when he talks about "paradigm shift" and choosing between rival theories. In reality, empirical knowledge is just as impossible to validate in a general way as theoretical knowledge is, the reason being the same in the two cases. Kuhn's mistake on this point makes theoretical knowledge look less reliable than experimental knowledge. In experimental work, the validation of a hypothesized knowledge is done by deducing it from the data, whereas in theoretical work, validation is done by deducing from data not the theory that is being tested but some consequences deduced from it. I explained and exemplified these operations in detail in my books. Those who read Kuhn should avoid sharing his mistake, which closed some disciplines of science, notably psychology, to the construction and use of theories. A survey showed Kuhn as the author most frequently quoted by psychologists. Knowledge supplied by a theory in its field of validity is as sure as empirical knowledge, and in this sense, skeptics can say, "it is only scientific knowledge" just as they say, "it is only a theory." A theory is derived, not deduced, from empirical knowledge but transcends empirical knowledge. Psychologists need to learn how this is done by physicists if they want to make psychology a mature science with theories instead of "schools" like philosophy and the arts. Kuhn also sees no difference between science and philosophy, evidently because he ignores the process of the validation of knowledge. Plato said that philosophy was only about possibilities. In opposition to this, science produces knowledge that is tested in relation to some singular phenomena and is then generalized through induction and accepted as generally valid in a certain area of reality. Kuhn's solution to the problem of how to choose between rival theories is that Europeans have a yet non-understood ability to choose the right theories. This is an Aristotelian tautology befitting a philosopher ignorant of the methods of science. Feyerabend remarked that Kuhn failed to explain the mission of science. Rating: 5good readOne of its kind in its own subject area. Kuhn writes with clarity and passion to develop a plausible thesis about scientific discovery and how it comes aboutRating: 5Comments as the driver of a new scientific revolution in a sub-field of physicsThomas Kuhn's book has provided comfort for me personally. There is no need to go into the details of his arguments. For example, whether the old generation has to die before paradigm shift can take place is not the issue. The issue is whether scientists resist anything new that cannot be fitted into the existing paradigm. Whether it took ten years or a lifetime for people to accept the theory of the origin of ulcers is irrelevant. I am disagreeing with the review by Peter Hobson (Groton, CT USA), 12/25/2005. What's important is the initial reaction of the community to new ideas. I have evidence to support the observations and analysis by T. Kuhn. Revolutionary ideas and theories gain faster acceptance if the new paradigm can quickly lead to economical and social benefits. I believe this is why the story of ulcers so quickly received the recognition of Nobel Prize in Medicine. If the idea leads to more effective treatment, who could hold up its consequences? Even the opponent would embrace it immediately because he would not want to suffer from ulcers. The problem is that sometime the benefit of making a paradigm shift is not immediately obvious. The defendant of the old paradigm simply resists changes to protect his reputation that is merely built on perfecting the old paradigm. It is difficult for most to appreciate the point of view expressed in Kuhn's book because most readers are not involved in a process of scientific revolution. As someone solely responsible for a scientific revolution occurring in a sub-branch of physics, I can verify based on my experience, i.e., on the reaction to our work that Kuhn is right on the money. Let me quote three remarks by the member of the community, first on my published scientific article, second on a rejected manuscript, and the third on my declined proposal to the National Science Foundation: "To say that the conclusions drawn by the submitted article are controversial is an understatement of Herculean proportion....While scientific advancement often requires the disproving of established thought, the authors of this work attempt to do so without sufficient proof. The material responses described in this article could be ascribed to other physical processes, including those that adhere to the traditional school of thought...The urgency to abandon conventional wisdom without sound basis is disturbing." "The Comment by xxx (two of whom are xxx Medalists) makes a very strong case for dismissing the main results of xxx (the present reviewer). Unfortunately, the Reply makes ZERO valid counterpoints and consequently should not be published. If xxx (the present reviewer) want to admit their mistakes and explain how they fell into the trap of publishing erroneous results, this might be useful so that others do not make similar mistakes in the future." "Overall, the PI needs to calm down considerably. In this proposal and his recent papers, the PI tries valiantly to sell his work as the single most important breakthrough in the history of science! In fact, both the proposed and recent work is reasonable, but the overselling done by the PI irritates people." I hope that people like Mr. Peter Hobson would in the future interview some people involved in scientific revolutions before making comments that could be misleading. It is very sad that the phenomena described by Thomas Kuhn are real. I have learned to be patient and more tolerant after reading the book. I am also very intrigued by his definition of Science as well as his statements regarding textbooks that present science as absolute truth without offering any historical perspective and describing where it comes from and who is chiefly responsible for creating it. I hope to write about these issues at another time.Rating: 5Scientific RevolutionsExcellent book. This is a must read for anyone working in the sciences. Very well written and really brings up some interesting philosophical issues. It's a quick read too.Rating: 5A classic in philosophy of scienceThis book has become a classic in philosophy of science. Kuhn's description of how science works was considered by some critics to be overly relativistic, by others as irresponsible and even dangerous (e.g. Steve Fuller). Whatever one thinks of it, Kuhn took away the aura of infallibility, and described science as made by scientists - it is a human activity, and since humans are prone to error, so is science. Moreover, what is considered to be "science" cannot be established a priori or once and for all, but depends fully on the social context in which science is done. If you know nothing about philosophy of science, this book is not an easy read, especially because in this book Kuhn describes his ideas often in a rather abstract manner. Nonetheless, for a philosophy book, it is surprisingly accessible. Kuhn attempts to avoid philosophical jargon as much as possible. Moreover, if you have},

abstract = {We use stellar dynamics, strong lensing, stellar population synthesis models, and weak lensing shear measurements to constrain the dark matter (DM) profile and stellar mass in a sample of 53 massive early-type galaxies. We explore three DM halo models (unperturbed Navarro Frenk {\&} White [NFW] halos and the adiabatic contraction models of Blumenthal and Gnedin) and impose a model for the relationship between the stellar and virial mass (i.e., a relationship for the star-formation efficiency as a function of halo mass). We show that, given our model assumptions, the data clearly prefer a Salpeter-like initial mass function (IMF) over a lighter IMF (e.g., Chabrier or Kroupa), irrespective of the choice of DM halo. In addition, we find that the data prefer at most a moderate amount of adiabatic contraction (Blumenthal adiabatic contraction is strongly disfavored) and are only consistent with no adiabatic contraction (i.e., a NFW halo) if a mass-dependent IMF is assumed, in the sense of a more massive normalization of the IMF for more massive halos.},

abstract = {Theoretical and empirical research highlights the role of punishment in promoting collaborative efforts1, 2, 3, 4, 5. However, both the emergence and the stability of costly punishment are problematic issues. It is not clear how punishers can invade a society of defectors by social learning or natural selection, or how second-order free-riders (who contribute to the joint effort but not to the sanctions) can be prevented from drifting into a coercion-based regime and subverting cooperation. Here we compare the prevailing model of peer-punishment6, 7, 8 with pool-punishment, which consists in committing resources, before the collaborative effort, to prepare sanctions against free-riders. Pool-punishment facilitates the sanctioning of second-order free-riders, because these are exposed even if everyone contributes to the common good. In the absence of such second-order punishment, peer-punishers do better than pool-punishers; but with second-order punishment, the situation is reversed. Efficiency is traded for stability. Neither other-regarding tendencies or preferences for reciprocity and equity, nor group selection or prescriptions from higher authorities, are necessary for the emergence and stability of rudimentary forms of sanctioning institutions regulating common pool resources and enforcing collaborative efforts.},

New developments in multidimensional scaling (MDS) enable us not only to visualize these patterns at each moment of time, but also to animate them over time. Using title words, co-authors, and journal names in Garfield's oeuvre, the method is demonstrated and further developed in this paper (and in the animation at http://www.leydesdorff.net/garfield/animation). The variety and substantive content of the animation enables us to write, visualize, and animate the author's intellectual history.},

abstract = {A model is proposed for the creation and transmission of scientific knowledge, based on the network of citations among research articles. The model allows to assign to each article a nonnegative value for its creativity, i. e. its creation of new knowledge. If the entire publication network is truncated to the first neighbors of an article (the n references that it makes and the m citations that it receives), its creativity value becomes a simple function of n and m. After splitting the creativity of each article among its authors, the cumulative creativity of an author is then proposed as an indicator of her or his merit of research. In contrast with other merit indicators, this creativity index yields similar values for the top scientists in two very different areas (life sciences and physics), thus offering good promise for interdisciplinary analyses.},

abstract = {As online social networking emerges, there has been increased in- terest to utilize the underlying social structure as well as the avail- able social information to improve search. In this paper, we focus on improving the performance of information collection from the neighborhood of a user in a dynamic social network. To this end, we introduce sampling based algorithms to quickly approximate quantities of interest from the vicinity of a user's social graph. We then introduce and analyze variants of this basic scheme exploring correlations across our samples. Models of centralized and dis- tributed social networks are considered. We show that our algo- rithms can be utilized to rank items in the neighborhood of a user, assuming that information for each user in the network is avail- able. Using real and synthetic data sets, we validate the results of our analysis and demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithms in approximating quantities of interest. The methods we describe are general and can probably be easily adopted in a variety of strategies aiming to efficiently collect information from a social graph.},

Moreover, elite universities play a dominant role in this shift. By examining 4.2 million papers published over three decades, we found that multi-university collaborations (i) are the fastest growing type of authorship structure, (ii) produce the highest-impact papers when they include a top-tier university, and (iii) are increasingly stratified by in-group university rank. Despite the rising frequency of research that crosses university boundaries, the intensification of social stratification in multi-university collaborations suggests a concentration of the production of scientific knowledge in fewer rather than more centers of high-impact science.},

abstract = {Despite their importance for urban planning, traffic forecasting and the spread of biological and mobile viruses, our understanding of the basic laws governing human motion remains limited owing to the lack of tools to monitor the time-resolved location of individuals. Here we study the trajectory of 100,000 anonymized mobile phone users whose position is tracked for a six-month period. We find that, in contrast with the random trajectories predicted by the prevailing L{\'{e}}vy flight and random walk models, human trajectories show a high degree of temporal and spatial regularity, each individual being characterized by a time-independent characteristic travel distance and a significant probability to return to a few highly frequented locations. After correcting for differences in travel distances and the inherent anisotropy of each trajectory, the individual travel patterns collapse into a single spatial probability distribution, indicating that, despite the diversity of their travel history, humans follow simple reproducible patterns. This inherent similarity in travel patterns could impact all phenomena driven by human mobility, from epidemic prevention to emergency response, urban planning and agent-based modelling.},

Even more surprising was the discovery that power-law distributions also characterize many biological and social networks. Many attributed a deep significance to this fact, inferring a "universal architecture" of complex systems. Closer examination, however, challenges the assumptions that (1) such distributions are special and (2) they signify a common architecture, independent of the system's specifics. The real surprise, if any, is that power-law distributions are easy to generate, and by a variety of mechanisms. The architecture that results is not universal, but particular; it is determined by the actual constraints on the system in question.},

@article{Clauset2008,
abstract = {Networks have in recent years emerged as an invaluable tool for describing and quantifying complex systems in many branches of science. Recent studies suggest that networks often exhibit hierarchical organization, in which vertices divide into groups that further subdivide into groups of groups, and so forth over multiple scales. In many cases the groups are found to correspond to known functional units, such as ecological niches in food webs, modules in biochemical networks (protein interaction networks, metabolic networks or genetic regulatory networks) or communities in social networks. Here we present a general technique for inferring hierarchical structure from network data and show that the existence of hierarchy can simultaneously explain and quantitatively reproduce many commonly observed topological properties of networks, such as right-skewed degree distributions, high clustering coefficients and short path lengths. We further show that knowledge of hierarchical structure can be used to predict missing connections in partly known networks with high accuracy, and for more general network structures than competing techniques. Taken together, our results suggest that hierarchy is a central organizing principle of complex networks, capable of offering insight into many network phenomena.},

We find that the pseudogap (PG) phase persists deep inside the overdoped region but terminates at x approximately 0.05, which corresponds to the hole doping concentration of approximately 0.21. Beyond this critical point, the normal state is a Fermi liquid that persists as the ground state when superconductivity is removed by the magnetic field. A comparison of the superconducting state with the H-induced normal state in the x=0.40 (Tc=32 K) sample indicates that there remains substantial part of the Fermi surface even in the fully developed PG state, which suggests that the PG and SC are coexisting matters.},

abstract = {In physical, biological, technological and social systems, interactions between units give rise to intricate networks. These-typically non-trivial-structures, in turn, critically affect the dynamics and properties of the system. The focus of most current research on complex networks is, still, on global network properties. A caveat of this approach is that the relevance of global properties hinges on the premise that networks are homogeneous, whereas most real-world networks have a markedly modular structure. Here, we report that networks with different functions, including the Internet, metabolic, air transportation and protein interaction networks, have distinct patterns of connections among nodes with different roles, and that, as a consequence, complex networks can be classified into two distinct functional classes on the basis of their link type frequency. Importantly, we demonstrate that these structural features cannot be captured by means of often studied global properties.},

abstract = {The abrupt occurrence of a devastating stroke has been referred to as "super death." It has long been realized that ischemic cerebral vascular disease may become symptomatic with a wide variety of clinical patterns. A robust circle of Willis has been recognized for its major protective function in many cases. When it became possible to actually create new collateral circulation to the brain by microsurgical techniques, significant enthusiasm arose. This enthusiasm was interrupted by the negative results of the international randomized trial. Further analysis of the trial raised serious questions regarding incomplete randomization by contributors to the study, and there remains uncertainty about important potential benefits for some individuals. Long-term follow-up of 3 patients having different and complex circumstances is described to emphasize this concern. After the creation of reliable collateral circulation to the brain, none has experienced new ischemic deficit during the subsequent follow-up of 27, 25, and 12 years, respectively.},

abstract = {Complex networks describe a wide range of systems in nature and society, much quoted examples including the cell, a network of chemicals linked by chemical reactions, or the Internet, a network of routers and computers connected by physical links. While traditionally these systems were modeled as random graphs, it is increasingly recognized that the topology and evolution of real networks is governed by robust organizing principles. Here we review the recent advances in the field of complex networks, focusing on the statistical mechanics of network topology and dynamics. After reviewing the empirical data that motivated the recent interest in networks, we discuss the main models and analytical tools, covering random graphs, small-world and scale-free networks, as well as the interplay between topology and the network's robustness against failures and attacks.},

This is changing the nature of collaboration and expanding opportunities to participate in science. If digital technologies are the engine of this revolution, digital data are its fuel. But for many scientific disciplines, this fuel is in short supply. The publication of primary data is not a universal or mandatory part of science, and despite policies and proclamations to the contrary, calls to make data publicly available have largely gone unheeded. In this short essay I consider why, and explore some of the challenges that lie ahead, as we work toward a database of everything.},

abstract = {The availability of new data sources on human mobility is opening new avenues for investigating the interplay of social networks, human mobility and dynamical processes such as epidemic spread- ing. Here we analyze data on the time-resolved face-to-face proximity of individuals in large-scale real-world scenarios. We compare two settings with very different properties, a scientific confer- ence and a long-running museum exhibition. We track the behavioral networks of face-to-face proximity, and characterize them from both a static and a dynamic point of view, exposing impor- tant differences as well as striking similarities. We use our data to investigate the dynamics of a susceptible-infected model for epidemic spreading that unfolds on the dynamical networks of human proximity. The spreading patterns are markedly different for the conference and the museum case, and they are strongly impacted by the causal structure of the network data. A deeper study of the spreading paths shows that the mere knowledge of static aggregated networks would lead to erroneous conclusions about the transmission paths on the dynamical networks.},
